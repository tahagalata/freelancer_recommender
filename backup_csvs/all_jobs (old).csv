Either do the valuation directly or research individuals or companies to evaluate the worth of my product and all the other items associated with the product.    If you don't want to do valuation; then you only need to put in touch with the right people or companies; presumably business brokers or similar entities.  It is helpful, but not required to have a background in medical devices, healthcare and FDA regulatory affairs.   To this end, the individual tasks are: 1. Reach out to anyone you can find and make inquiries 2. Explain the background and see if they can do an evaluation and obviously gather all the details about the valuation (Cost, Time, Details, etc.) 3. Either do the valuation or find the proper entity to do it.  I will provide any technical background they require.  Background  I have a medical device that is ready to sell. It has all of these attributes: • Fully patented (not patent pending) • FDA 510k clearance to sell the device as a prescription device (510k Rx) • FDA 510k clearance to sell the device Over the Counter (510k OTC) • Manufacturing has been established. The device is manufactured via injection mold and the mold has been manufactured.  Up to 1M units can be produced in a short amount of time. • There is a website (under construction) run by a medical marketing professional and is available (if desired) • The patent and all the submissions / updates / filings are up to date with the patent attorneys.  I believe the first 4 bullets hold the value, the last two are there for completeness.|$75.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Business Analysis & Strategy Skills,Business Valuation|$262.50||United States San Diego|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013a7d727fa7409c46

The second round of funding will be for year 2 onwards, amounting to $160m.

0|1740|Grant Researcher, Writer, Editor|Hello! Our nonprofit organization, USA Green Communities, was founded in Santa Barbara, CA in 2010, by a former mayor of Santa Barbara and pioneer of the environmental movement, Hal Conklin, who was instrumental in the establishment of what is now Earth Day, following a massive oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel in 1969. Our flagship project is a Green Products Database of independently certified green products and services. With a $500,000 grant from Wells Fargo, Phase One of the project was completed prior to the pandemic (and Hal's passing last year as a result of a brain tumor), and the database currently contains over 120,000 certified products. Our goal is 200,000+ products, and is inspired by a similar project (though much smaller) in South Korea, which also includes a green credit card that provides incentives and points for sustainable purchasing to over 18-million users. We recently received unsolicited interest in our database by the head of product sustainability for the largest online retailer on the planet (guess who?). Since the database is owned by our nonprofit organization, which funds development of the database through an independent contractor, we need to raise $1.3-million over the next 12 months to complete the project. Grants will be key to achieving this goal. The organization has deep roots and connections locally and nationally, and we believe that there is certainly sufficient support out there for this project. We would be looking to apply for grants at the 25k-500k levels. Much of the copy for this project has been written, via a 12-page Program/Business Plan.

0|1740|Local PR Professional Needed|Hey guys!  Thanks for taking the time to read this job post.  We run an SEO agency and are looking to package together something for our local clients that includes SEO, social, and local PR with a link building focus.  For local PR, here's a scalable angle I'm working on that we can continue to use for clients everywhere, even if they share a market.  I call it the “Do Good and Do Well” campaign.  Basically, on the consult call with a client, we ask them what sucks in their market.  They’ll say something like “oh the homeless issue man. I hate that these people have to…” whatever. We find a problem in their community they’re passionate about fixing.  Then, we find a very basic, small way they can help. So for covid that would have been giving away masks early on.  Once we’ve found a problem and an affordable way to implement a solution, we consult them through that, build a page for it on their website with some sharable graphics or video content, and pitch local journalists stories with headlines formatted like this:  “Local Business Giving Away SOLUTION To Help With PROBLEM”  Initial research can be done to find out what problems local news outlets are talking about so we can map this type of thing to their audience's interests as well.  It’d be a hyper-relevant way to get local backlinks.  I'm looking for someone who can help manage this kind of effort for our agency. This means I need someone with experience in local PR, but project management, communication, management, and recruitment skills are a huge plus.  Looking forward to speaking with you!|$50.00|More than 30 hrs/week|More than 6 months||Public Relations,Media Relations,Content Writing,Search Engine Optimization,link building,Writing,Social Media Marketing|$3,466.68|5.0|United States Orange Park|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0195151de03c9bebbf

Beyond a lifestyle of doing less bad, but stepping into doing more good, being a vector of regeneration, a participant in direct restoration of ecology, community and local economy. My thesis revolves around eco-villages participating in regenerative micro-industry as being a critical long term solution that will be relevant beyond immediate technological mitigations. I have a broad qualitative argument for why people living in eco-villages being paid to create regenerative life giving systems is fundamental, for one, taking folks out of endless cycles of self soothing through consumerism into a life of purpose and connection. I am building a fractally scalable toolbox and process for building regenerative communities. Come help lay the stones that other can build from, build a world that we are happy to live in a proud to hand down.  In many cases my proposals are logical next steps for supply chain and manufacturing, but I need to strengthen the part of the argument that is most core to my purpose, climate, ecology, social etc.  For now I need to focus on unpacking carbon sequestration and climate change into its sub-pieces like soil regeneration, biodiversity, circular supply chains etc.  You are a researcher who has previous experience in climate research and can feel a magnetism to what I am describing. You are a critical thinker who can find blindspots and identify credible resources.  I Eli, am an inventor, entrepreneur, and decentralized systems architect.

0|365|Virtual Assistant - Ebay Lister|Job Title: Ebay Lister Job Responsibilities: Data Entry, Create Ebay Listings, Price Research, and Determine Shipping Costs for Shoes (priced $80 to $95 - everything else is free shipping) Required Applicant Qualities: Must need VPN to access US-based websites such as eBay, Access to Google Drive, and English language proficiency to communicate effectively Desired Applicant Qualities: Excellent communication skills, Willingness to learn, the Ability to follow clearly defined instructions, prior eBay listing experience, knowledge of eBay fees  Tools Necessary: Virtual Assistant will need access to a gmail account so files can be sent back and forth and so spreadsheets can be shared via google accounts, a VPN so he/she can access US-based sites, and a chat service we can communicate via,  the eBay app, smart phone, and computer/laptop.  Two Main Job Responsibilities: Logging Buy Costs & Listing on eBay  Logging Buy Costs - To start, you will be sent receipts and purchase orders daily that you must log into a shared Google Spreadsheet. The total cost, and any cash-back savings will be included. Everyday I would like you to spend an hour just logging all of those purchase costs into a shared Google spreadsheet so we can both use that information for pricing items.  After an hour of logging buy costs, you will list for 2-3 hours for a total of 3-4 hours per day of work total.  Listing on eBay - You will be sent all of the photographs of the items, descriptions to use for specific items, and you will even be told what to price at to start (but eventually you will have to price items yourself).  When creating listings you must always start by knowing your buy cost and then searching for sold comps to get an idea of value. If the item is not profitable after estimating fees and shipping then just let me know. After the value is established and the item is indeed profitable, you will create a new listing by clicking the button “sell one like this” on a sold listing that looks professional. This way you can save a lot of time by using the information from that listing, but obviously you must double check that the information is accurate!  From there, your job will be to use all of that information from the photographs I provided to determine a detailed and well-put title for each item, to copy & paste the appropriate description, and to determine what to price based on sold listings. You must also go through the item specifics to ensure they are all correct (i.e. a softcover book may be mistakenly listed as hardcover) and also add any main details as possible but I stay away from most of the minor item specifics. You will use free shipping for most listings besides shoes valued over $75 and less than $90 dollars because shoes over $74.99 are required to use a standard $15 Fedex Label and go through authentication. To avoid that  and save the buyer shipping time we price a shoe valued at 90 as $74.95 with flat $10 shipping cost. Or a pair of shoes that is valued at 80 would be $69.95 with flat $10 shipping. Always end prices in .95 or .49 to keep it uniform!  If these steps are followed exactly, you should be able to list upwards of 20 listings per hour if not more as I average 20-30/hour.  Proof of Work- I will be able to monitor your progress as you log the buy costs and I will surely double check each eBay listing, but to further shown the work has been done, at the end of each task I will require you to just zoom out and send me a screenshot or two of the spreadsheet showing the logged buy costs. Also, to show you had listed on eBay you will either screenshot or send a screen recording scrolling through all of  the listings you had completed for the day.||Less than 30 hrs/week|More than 6 months|Intermediate|Virtual Assistance,eBay Listing,Data Entry,Product Listings,Email Communication|$10.00|5.0|United States Hellertown|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01414c49e8d36d4520

In addition to finding companies for the directory, I need help developing a data taxonomy that will allow users to easily search and filter results not only based on business details (including logo), but also industry, type of services offered (tech, professional services, both), area of specialization (one law versus another), hosting, etc. In performing this part of the analysis, I would appreciate your review of other software directories to get ideas for additional information that we might be able to compile.  I've used a few data mining tools (Crunchbase, scrapers, etc.) to compile the existing list but am open to others if you have suggestions. I suspect if we expand the universe of regulated industries (healthcare, cannabis, etc.), we can identify another 1,000-1,500 companies.  To be successful at this project, I need you to research regtech and develop a deep understanding of the industries served and the nuance between their services. Since this is being compiled for a directory, precise business classification and data structure/organization is critical for this work. If you apply, please describe your current understanding of regtech and generally how you plan to research it further.

We seek a researcher to catalogue the estimated 1,000 programs, initiatives and organizations currently administering nature-rich interventions to veterans and active-duty service members suffering from PTSD, TBI and other conditions.  Background: Following wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, American troops returned to the United States suffering from PTSD and TBI in unprecedented numbers. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), charged with caring for military veterans, lacked effective interventions to address these conditions. Studies conducted as part of the Green Road Project and the Naval Medical Center’s Surf and Hike Therapy trial indicated that nature-rich interventions such as hiking, surfing, hunting and angling provided more successful outcomes than traditional (pharmaceutical) interventions, but they did not gain widespread adoption with the VA.  Frustrated with the VA’s interventions, many veterans began taking matters into their own hands, founding nonprofit organizations that incorporated nature-rich interventions into programming that benefited their peers. Problematically, little coordination between these nonprofit organizations exists, resulting in fragmentation, siloing and lack of communication between natural allies.  The development of a database to catalogue the myriad initiatives currently underway will assist with standardization of protocols, establishment of best practices, shared results and communications among principals. This in turn will provide value to veterans, the VA, the Department of Defense and its responsibilities to provide continuity of care for active duty service members as they transition to civilian life.|||1 to 3 months||Data Entry,Writing,Researcher|$150.00|5.0|United States Jackson|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01d78fad6263e1335d

The content of the audio is sometimes explicit, and sometimes contains explanations of, or conversations about potentially sensitive topics such as: domestic violence, alcohol consumption, assault, car accidents, etc.  These files are already transcribed with a standard format, and simply need to be reviewed for word-level accuracy and punctuation. Timestamps do not need to be reviewed. We will deliver the files to you and provide you with the applicable transcription standard conventions used by our partner so that you can identify and correct mistakes. You will be expected to make edits within the transcript, and deliver the edited transcripts to us to complete the task. We hope that you already have access to a preferred transcription software for use during this project. If not, Notepad++, while basic, is sufficient to complete this task.  Based on our experience auditing a batch of English transcripts in-house, we expect this task to take between 10 and 20 hours to complete. This can be divided into milestones if desired.||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/Transcription Types,Audio Transcription/Other,Quebec French Dialect,French,Quality Assurance|$627.75|5.0|United States Scottsdale|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e0c56c6f4811797d

We sell our services to companies which recruit international professionals.  To increase our brand awareness on our market, we regularly write and publish articles and ebooks. Mostly in English, but sometimes the first version is in French. In that case we have to translate them into English for our nonFrench audience.  Today, we want to hire a freelancer, who will be in charge of those translations.  Price: when benchmarking, I've found that the average cost per word translated is around $0.045. Would this price be okay for you?  I've seen your profile and reviews on Upwork, and I would like to try a collaboration with you. Do you have availabilities in the coming days for a first article?

The deliverable is a collection of screen recordings and screenshots for each of the 18 sites that are needed.  (There's also another Upwork job for the SELLING experience – feel free to look at that too.)  We are looking for someone with an eye for UX so they can call out and document particularly effective or poor examples of UX.  // Background We are building a Shopify-based platform to make resale easier for small to medium-sized fashion brands be more sustainable. We are beginning to get into the details of the UX flows for buying+selling secondhand items and want to understand all the patterns already being used. This keeps us from re-inventing the wheel and shows us places we can do better.  // Project details + deliverables There are 18 sites we've identified as interesting to us. For each site, you will act as a customer looking for a used item and go through the buying process – up to checkout – noting specific things (more below).  1. Start a screen recording 2. Click through the site as if you're browsing around – imagine you're not sure what to buy but you want something. 3. Look at some specific products paying particular attention to the way new and used items are presented. 4. Choose two items to purchase and add them to your cart. 5. Go through the checkout process as far as possible without adding a credit card. Create an account, if necessary.  Format of deliverables: 1. A screen recording of the whole process (your choice of software, e.g. Loom.com or QuickTime) 2. Screenshots of the following pages: Homepage, Product List page, Product Details page, all the checkout pages. 3. Separate screenshots (might be duplicates of the above) but with callouts for:     • Assurances of authenticity, guarantees or anything else that's intended to give the buyer confidence.     • Item condition.     • Seller reputation. 4. Put the video and screenshots in a folder, name it with the brand's name, and upload it to a Google Drive folder that will be shared with you.  ❗️Be sure to capture the whole length of the page when clipping screenshots – Firefox has a page clipper built-in or you can download a Chrome extension. ❗️Name files ""[Brand]-[Page]-[anything else].png""  // About us We’re a startup in the fashion space building a ""resale-as-a-service"" platform that enables any brand to accept clothing back and offer credit to customers, incentivizing them to keep garments out of landfills. Our first product is a Shopify App that plugs into existing e-commerce stores.  // Time commitment Each site should take no more than 20min.

Formulas are only included in Row 10 of the first worksheet and Row 9 of the second worksheet as this was an unfinished project.  To give you an idea of how I want this to flow, I want to start out asking for client details (name, production year, type of farm, etc.)  Based on those answers, they will need to complete different subsections of the form.  Each section will also have main questions as to what type of commodities were grown or marketed, and based on those answers, they will need to complete all the production information.  So basically, I want clients to provide the same information they need to provide on the files attached.  However, I want it to be more of a question and answer thing, and to only make them answer the parts of the survey/questionnaire that are relevant to their situation.||||Intermediate|Jotform,PDF||4.25|Canada Meaford|4.25|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0165ef1dd0cc048496

Conceptually, we are looking:   1.  to have a button or something like that as in shown in Cell B2 of the worksheet called Conntrolboard in the Financial Dashboard file. When pressed, the script would look into each file listed in Column A of the Controlboard and compile all the contents as shown in the sheet called InvestmentsCompiled.  2a. Further combine the data in the InvestmentsCompiled sheet into the Performance sheet. Columns A-D of the Performance sheet is effectively a pivot table of the data in InvestmentsCompiled. Columns E-G are formulas that can be reused. Column G is a concatenation of the Notes in each row that is combined as part of the pivot table.     2b. implement the dropdown shown in cell A1 of the Performance sheet that filters the data in InvestmentsCompiled based on one or more labels before that data gets pivot tabled.  3a. Implement the Portfolio table other than column F, which again is a pivot table from the InvestmentsCompiled sheet.  Column F of Portfolio is a hard one to implement and requires the LabelsCompiled and IRR per Label sheets that we will implement later.    3b. Implement a dropdown as shown in cell A1 of the Portfolio table that filters the rows of the InvestmentsCompiled to a subset of dates before that data gets pivot tabled.  I am listing this as a One Time Project but this is the first part of an at least three part project. Part 2 would be the IRR per Label calculations. Part 3 would be the creation of a dashboard. Part 4 could be the implementation of additional controls in the Controlboard.|||||/Platform Expertise,Google Sheets/Scripting & Automation Deliverables,Scripting|$300.00|5.0|United States Mountain View|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/01JpsCKH4-Okee0hKMy8hFEFazv1AmGidGoUkneRRdQUg=

I need it set up by employee name and each employee would have a list of 4 KPI measurements.  HR will then put a score of .25 /.5 / .75 or 1 if the employee meet that particular KPI.   In the back of the spreadsheet we would set a dollar amount say $500 towards that KPI.  If the employee only got .5 on that measurement they would only get $250 bonus for that particular KPI.      4 total KPI measurements per person.  Once I have the excel sheet I would duplicate it for other people, so one spreadsheet per person.  The .25 / .5 / .75 /1 etc etc would populate to a graph page with pictures and dollar amounts of the employee bonus amount for that month.  I would like the excel sheet to be very detailed and picture driven for the employee point of view with graphs we can copy and paste and send to them.|||||Microsoft Excel|$40.00||United States Branson|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e4f54172249e878b

0|1637|Scraper for creditcards.com|Here is a link to a number of popular Cashback credit cards in alphabetical order: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/cash-back/?orderby=product.name&order=ASC  When you go to one of these cards and hit Read Full Review you get the following link for a given credit card: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/amazon-prime-rewards-visa-signature-card-review/?reviewCategory=cash-back  On this Amazon Prime Visa card for instance we need to scrape the following things (ideally output these into a table with the following variables):  Name (Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card) Rewards Rate  (5% back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods purchases, 2% back on restaurant, gas station and drug store purchases, 1% back on other purchases) Sign-up Bonus ($100 Amazon Gift Card) Annual Bonus ($0) *Note they say ‘none’ instead of $0, we can collect it as ‘none’ however and clean it up manually to say $0 afterwards* Annual Fee ($0)  (we don’t need APR info, pros, cons, other features, etc. for now)  There are additional variables we need to scrape as well that may be present for some cards but not others. For example on the American Express Cash Magnet® Card: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/american-express-cash-magnet-card-review/?reviewCategory=cash-back  We need to collect the same info as above, like:   Name Rewards Rate Introductory Bonus *Note that they call it ‘Introductory Bonus’ here while in the previous example they called it ‘Sign-up Bonus’ - essentially the same thing* Annual Fee  Now in the introductory bonus we need to make sure we scrape the entire thing - not just the $200 piece but also the accompanying information “if you spend $2,000 in first 6 months”   We need to do this for all of the cards found in the first link in this doc. Be sure to keep clicking the “Show More Results” button to get all of the cards in that link.  Now that link is only targeted to the subset of cards that are flagged as good for Cashback. To capture full breadth of cards, we also need the scraper to conduct the same operation to all of these links as well:  https://www.creditcards.com/rewards-cards/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/business/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/airline/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/luxury/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/low-interest/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/hotel/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/credit-building/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/students/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/rewards/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/retail/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/no-annual-fee/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/travel/   *Note: Some cards may be duplicative across these links, please avoid duplication||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Data Extraction Deliverables,Data Extraction/Other,Data Scraping,Web Crawling|$60.00||United States New York|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01afa3086f4344eeb4

Please reply ""I can totally help"" so I know you're not a bot.  There should be a big button on the left in the ""Export"" worksheet a user can click and upon click, the following happens:  1) Look at the first 10 characters of each worksheet within the larger workbook and extract the matching ones to a new worksheet  2) Go to the ""Actuals"" tab within the new workbook and find the grand total of the pivot table (Column E). If there's no data in the pivot table, skip to step below.  3) Show the details for the cell containing the Total (double click) as a new worksheet and rename it from sheetX to ""Data"" and place it last in the new workbook  4) Save the workbook to the DESKTOP as the name of the worksheet before the text ""Summary"" and have the naming convention in cell ""=Export!D2"" following it. E.g. ""Bestbuy.com Jan - June Budget Summary 7.15.22""  5) Repeat this process until all worksheets and their matching pairs in the main workbook are saved.

There could 40+ of these, so the macro should cycle through and repeat until all matching sheets have been exported to a new workbook and saved with instructions and naming convention above.

From this database, we want to obtain a periodic statistics table to obtain the performance of each of our sales representatives over the last 8 days.  The table will therefore have to update automatically each day to display only the statistics of the last 8 days.  Example: On March 04, I would like to see the percentage of Tanguy's sales from 25/02 to 04/03 included.  On this same table, on 05/03 the stats will then be automatically calculated from 26/02 inclusive to 05/03 inclusive, without any manipulation on our part.  You can consult the structure of our database in attachment to this announcement.  We will share with you, if you wish, more details on our database following your response to this announcement.  ==FR==  Nous recherchons activement une personne maîtrisant l’outil Google Sheet enfin de réaliser le projet suivant :  Nous avons une base de données dans une feuille Google Sheet qui contient des informations sur les appels de nos commerciaux vers nos prospects (Appel Non Décroché, Vente Effectuée lors de l’appel, Rappel Programmé…).  À partir de cette base de données, nous voulons obtenir un tableau de statistique périodique pour obtenir les performances de chacun de nos commerciaux sur les 8 derniers jours.

0|573|Data scientist to help with developing career recommendation model|Hi Data Scientists,  I am looking for a talented data scientist to work with me clarify and run an existing career recommendation model that matches a survey with job data and ranks it.  The survey and data all available - what is really needed is someone who understands algorithms and can code-up a simple model that can accept a survey response and produce an output afterwards.  I am particularly interested in someone who is strong in maths and algorithms and has at least basic excel and excellent R tidyverse skills.  Once the model is clarified and running, I would like to work on a second job based on improving it.  Tasks: 1. Kick-off conversation with me so I can explain the model in more detail 2. Understand how the model works from end to end 3. Rebuild the model in a more simple, structured and tidy way (in Excel and R tidyverse) 4. Develop the model so that a survey can be taken by anyone and results can be automatically seen (in Excel and R) 5. Evaluate and test the current algorithm and scope other possible algorithms that could be used instead 6. Enhance the output of the model by for example showing not just ranked results but allowing for making adjustments to weightings to change results and also showing why the result were obtained (i.e. what survey responses drive the result across tasks, personality and other vs the typical result - why are you different than others)  Details on the model, the survey and data are attached below.  How the model works so far 1. This is a career recommendation model that matches a short survey (attached) with job-related task data (also attached dataset) with jobs to rank best-suited jobs. 2. You can follow how the model works in Excel Power Query by opening the excel file, clicking data - workbook queries and clicking on the various modelling blocks (e.g. 'Model'). 3. The model looks at 5 categories - career area, personality, education/experience and aptitude – and gives them equal weighting 100 points. 4. A person takes survey and answers questions with responses (from 1 to 10) for 83 questions across four areas of career area (33 questions), personality (6 questions), education/experience (2 questions) and aptitudes (41 questions). 5. There is also a score for each question in each job provided by psychologists to measure how much it represents that job. Using these psychologist scores, the four areas are rescaled to be worth 100 points each and then multiplied by 6, 2, 1 and 3 respectively to give effective weights of career area (100), personality (200), education/experience (100) and aptitudes (400). 6. These scores are then summed for each career and ranked and displayed in a list.||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||Data Science,Data Analysis,Statistics,Data Modeling,R coding|$120.00|5.0|Ireland Dublin|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01fff7e6ad3a766b12

For example, If a client answers question 1  = size 6.5 question 2 = wide width question 3 = bunions, then the recommendation (ending) should be 36 extra wide, with a link to this collection in my store.  But, if the answer to question 1  = size 6.5 question 2 = medium width question 3 = no issues, then the recommendation (ending) should be 36 medium, with a link to this collection in my store.

0|9|Data visualization developer to create interactive visualization for web|Hi there,  We need high quality data vis developer to help us create an interactive visualisation.  This is a small initial job, which we envisage to be a few days' work, that then might require some ongoing support.  In summary, we want to create a dual axis visualisation that combines 2x datasets.  You can see the examples here of the 2 charts we want to plot.  These are created in Flourish using their off-the-shelf tools: Dataset A: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8048171/ Dataset B: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8048695/  The aim is to combine these into one chart:  the cases as a line chart on one y-axis, incidents as stacked area on the other line.    We also want to plot a few annotations onto the graph, which will highlight some key events.   We also want to have the filter options, so users can filter by country and possibly turn data on/off. There should be similar type animation/interaction as shown in the Flourish examples.  The output visualisation will need to be embedded into Wordpress.  We want to be able to easily update the data and create versions for different regions (there will be 4 main regions, plus individual country versions).  We will provide the datasets. We will supply a combined visual of how we envisage the final chart looking (which is more for colour/font references)  We are open to the framework used, but we need to be able to update the data easily. Embedding into WP pages should be straightforward (using div or iframe).   When you respond, please can you clearly explain: -what framework/tool you'll use -how long it will take and your rates (budget provided is guide) -how we can manage the data easily to create other versions -what kind of support you can provide + turnaround times for initial project (when can you start, how long you think it'll take) -provide examples of similar work you've done  We are a small design team.

The course is for Californians 55+ and helps them become safer drivers while saving hundreds of dollars on their car insurance. In addition to the short video, we would like you to take these 3 images (attached). It won't be a suit, but a more casual look.  Background for character: you're a grandparent with two grandsons who visit you every weekend. you love taking them on long drives in your Cadillac deVille and you love your grandsons a lot. however, as a 62 year old, you feel your reflexes and driving skills are not the same anymore. its natural because that comes with aging (eyesight reduced, hearing not the same, you've forgotten defensive driving techniques, and maybe not kept up with the newest car technologies). You feel bad because you want to keep your grandsons safe but it's also an ego issue. Through a lot of searching you find our course which is approved by the California DMV. You learn to be a safer driver while saving hundreds of dollars on your car insurance every year.  1. Take those 3 images in a similar setting  2. We have a script ready - so we need a 20-30 second video that you can take on your phone - like a selfie video. Similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTRj39qdlmg.  3. You would need to sign a NDA and a rights release so that we can use your image/video freely for marketing purposes. This is our website: https://trafficsafetyinstitute.com/  Here's the script:  Hi, I’m Joe Philips, I’m 62 and I’m a grandpa! If you're older than 55 and have a driving license, please watch this 30-second video till the end! My favorite part of the weekend is driving my grandkids around town in my Cadillac deVille! They LOVE it! But… even saying this out loud hurts my ego, so bear with me… I’m aware that my driving skills and reflexes are not what they were 20 years ago… That’s it, I said it! I admit, even though it hurts every cell in my body, I admit: my eyesight is not the same, my reflexes are way slower, and even my hearing has weakened… Under no circumstance would I admit such things, let alone make it public, but can really pride and ego outweigh the safety of my grandkids? If you're older than 55 and have a driving license, click the button below to see what I did to polish my driving skills, save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance and most importantly make weekend rides with my grandkids safer than ever!||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/Age,Senior Adult/Other,Male,Acting,US English Dialect,Middle-Aged Adult|$275.00|5.0|United States Pasadena|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a7f56d039d4ce951

0|507|Rebranding/Logo design for fitness based physical therapy|Hello! I am looking for someone to help me rebrand/create a new logo for me. I run a physical therapy clinic that is fitness-forward, and performance-based. The previous name was FarrNorth Performance and Rehab (my last name is Farr and I live in Alaska) and I am changing it to Tier XI Training and Rehab.  Why? Tier XI (eleven) being above top level, higher than 10, as we expect to exceed expectations and provide the highest quality care. Also, XI being symbolic of renewal and awakening after the most challenging personal year I have had.  I want the logo to represent strength and resilience in life, but also have a slight feminine component as I am the owner and sole practitioner and want to ensure my fellow females feel proud and comfortable supporting my brand and business.  Attached is my previous logo. I don’t want it to be too generic, since I’m not a chain or franchise of physical therapy clinics and more mom+pop style.  Really looking forward to working with someone to share my passion in my logo and dream of being a self employed small business owner.  Cheers!

This is a one-time job for now but any talented designer, graphics or otherwise, I'll certainly keep in touch with and potentially use in the future for graphic presentations to clients.  The company needs business cards, letterhead, a physical stamp for various items (approved, received, denied, business letters, etc) and a few other things typical to a creative industry that I don't currently have the time to do myself since my own architectural workload is a little full at the moment. I've attached the current two logos, and some sample work we do so that you can understand the style of design we hold.  Ideally, if you could submit samples of your past work or the proposed design to me with your submittal it'd be appreciated. I WILL NOT take any of your work, as a designer I know how important our intellectual property is, but am asking for something so I can pick the right designer and work with them.  Working jointly on the design you submitted, to fine-tune the design of the logo and branded items.  I cannot pay much now but this will be a good portfolio builder as you'll always be able to claim you branded an architectural firm, and there is potential repeat business in the deal for the right person come presentation time to clients.  My website, which is under construction, is wakedesign.org and for that matter, if you'd like to offer up web design assistance let's talk about that too.  Thank you.

0|859|3 Brand-aligned Designs/Fine Art for Shirts|"Hello Artists!  We are seeking new illustrations / designs for our retail line. We're establishing the brand re-fresh with the below aesthetic guidelines.  Currently the focus is new designs for t-shirt/tanks on unisex and women's blanks.  We'd like to start with 3 different but aligned designs, with option to re-hire for more since we'll need about 10 total for our next run.  BACKGROUND: The brand (Melrose Moto) was built out of our busy motorcycle service shop, which extended into gear sales and now everyday apparel. We are on a busy boulevard attracting a mix of non-riding individuals as well as moto enthusiasts and avid riders. The shop has a classic, dark wood design, tin tiled ceiling, plays classic rock, displays clothing with metal piping, housing casual but fashionable fits and fabrics for men and women.  GOAL: 1) Grab non-riding shoppers off the street using less motorcycle specific designs (we have a hand full of motorcycle art on shirts already) and more cross over themes. 2) Build our 'look' with the below brand guides which carve out our own space against our competitors.    NEEDED: ROUND ONE is a total of 3 new illustration designs. - 2 brand-aligned designs that use cross-over themes of freedom, open road, moving     forward, taking the wheel, adventure, peace of mind, - 1 new moto-inspired design.  Style of art we like: -line-design -fine art soft brush paint -sketch / charcoal  *NO* skulls/eagles/flags/comic cartoons/harley themes/rocker/goth   *****MELROSE MOTO BRAND GUIDES***** VISUAL EXAMPLES ATTACHED AS A STARTING GUIDE ONLY  Color & Style: -golds -deep red/blue/green -1920/30s art / bikes -regal -classic lean fonts -soft brush/poster art (see images attached)  *we don't need to use our past logos  Main Themes/Symbols/Targets:  1) Industrial-creative era: wheels/gadgets/bike parts/the-making-of/building/locomotives, riders that value mechanics, bikes are works of art. Symbols of the industrial era & Renaissance men/women.  2) Early century racer bikes, track winners, famous races  3) Transport /Magic- freedom, serenity, desert, mountain scenes, open, possibilities, journey. dreamers. 'City of Dreams'. 'Magic Metropolis'.  Additional outlier theme: (take a stab only if this excites you/ is your forte) 4) 90s inspired  (VHS/cassette/famous tv shows/characters/cars) but minimal. Vibrant secondary blues/purples/pinks - 80s 90s fonts and more generic slogans.  LOGO/SLOGAN OPTIONS: If desired, words to use, not necessary. We don't want to add our logo to everything: ""Melrose Moto"", ""Melrose Ave"", ""Melrose Motorcycle Company"". ""Never Quit"" ""Carpe Dium"" ""Head Up"" ""Do It"" ""Keep On"" ""Facing Forward"" ""Forward Motion"" “The places you'll go"" ""Go Outside"" ""Go Your Own Way"" ""Make Your Mark"" ""Come Together""  If applying these, we'd like to see with and without words.

I am working on a cover for my book, but this piece is extra special to me as it is of a vision of my daughter I lost. So I plan on having this piece also framed in my home.  This book is a Christian memoir, and this vision is an essential piece to this book as it is to my heart. It doesn’t need to be a very big piece, maybe an 8x10. But there needs to be detailed to my vision.  There maybe other projects from this later as well.

0|859|Need an outstanding mural designed for our new coworking space!|"We are creating a small office rental and coworking space that primarily caters to entrepreneurs and artists. We have 22 individual offices plus a larger coworking room where we will have people who would like to work in a shared space or artists looking for a temporary studio space. The key demographic here is startup business owners/entrepreneurs , independent artists, or the type of people that frequent Starbucks to try and get some work down out of the house. Since we are targetting entrepreneurial and creative types, the mural should be enticing to this demographic as well as to city officials.  We plan on partnering with local art classes to see if we can involve local middle and high school art students, so we need a top notch artist to design a mural we can then give to local painters to put on the wall.  The name of the building is ""Historic Jonesboro Executive Offices and Coworking""  The wall is divided by two columns, creating 3 potential canvas areas. The mural can either be three individual but related designs, or one large design for the entire wall, with or without use of columns. We are open to any creative ideas you might have. The wall is primarily brick, so that should be taken into consideration with amount of detail in the design. We would very much like to keep the brick texture of the wall. Ideally a lighter color scheme should be used as well, as we do not what to make the room look ""smaller"" with too many dark colors.  We only have two creative requirements:  1) The mural MUST be a mural focused on Jonesboro, Georgia, USA. Jonesboro is located just south of Atlanta, Georgia. The building is located in the heart of Jonesboro in the historic district, so the mural MUST be about Jonesboro.  Ideally, the mural will include cultural aspects of the city as well. Given the name of the building, we want to lean into the history and culture of the city. It can include past, present, or future themes of the city, or any notable citizens you may come across. Additional inclusions can come from Clayton County, Georgia as well, which is where Jonesboro is located, but again, the main focus should be the city itself. Bottom line, if the mural design does not have a major focus on Jonesboro, GA then it will not be considered.  2) The movie Gone With The Wind (filmed in Jonesboro) should NOT be a primary focus of the mural. It can be included in some MINOR elements, but we do not want it to be a Gone with the Wind mural. There are already plenty of those in Jonesboro. So, it's an overdone concept.  There is also a new park and government complex being constructed close by, called Lee Street Park and Amphitheatre, which could also be a good inclusion. Basically, we are looking for something that would make residents of Jonesboro and the city council proud.  The mural can be thought provoking or a little provocative if you choose. Clayton County has a checkered past and historical issues with racism, but obviously we don't want anything to be too critical of the city or county. The city and county are also experiencing a large demographic shift with African Americans being the largest source of population growth, so this should be taken into account either in design itself or considerations for what not to include. Our tenant base is also majority African American.  Finally, if not already included, the design should also include a full release for our use and distribution, and to be recreated on our wall as a mural.  Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the city or its history as I do not live close by and haven't had much time to investigate, so I won't be much help in providing historical or cultural ideas at the moment.

0|859|ISO Incredible Artist for digital art, painting and logo|My business is life coaching as a specialist in trauma. I use many modalities and tools to work with my clients and get to the root of their trauma.(yes this is all relevant tit he project, keep reading)  Through the healing process comes empowerment and out of the empowerment comes purpose, direction, understanding, energy renewal and the confidence needed to rebuild and recreate. I help my clients obtain and work toward their life’s purpose, break old habits that no longer serve and reach for the highest potential self.  The name of my website is The Lotus and The Lion. There is a long story behind the name but to simplify it, it’s another representation of yin and yang, light and dark, soft and small, big and strong. Both the lotus and the lion individually are very symbolic throughout ancient history. Symbols of enlightenment, strength, power, effortless thriving..:you get it.  I am also a Mayan Astrologer and use this ancient wisdom and marry it with today’s science of the mind, the body and emotions.  Now for the project, currently the website has a photo of me on the front and my son is still in the creation process but it’s close to done. It just needs the art and a logo to complete.  I think a timeless art piece rich in symbolism, incorporating the cholq’ij (Mayan calendar), the Lion, the lotus with a feeling of healing, universal keys, strength, empowerment and gratitude is the feelings that I’m going for. I would love to have an actual painting of it in my studio and a digital version on the website.  Over time I expect this project to evolve into something much larger than just coaching. Public speaking, retreats, workshop events, a shop and  books are all to come in the future which could mean more work for the artist if I’m happy with the result.  I originally had the thought of a Lion standing at the foot of a lotus pond staring into the water and what he sees back instead of his own reflection is a lotus. I feel it shows that we aren’t always what we project to the world and that the toughest exteriors can have a soft interior. Though I’m not stuck on that vision and still open to ideas.  Looking forward someone who can paint and also convert the actual painting into digital art. I’m interested either way.  Also looking for a simple logo and possible branding....||||Intermediate|/Analog Art Types,Painting/Other,Graphic Design,Branding,Logo Design,Digital Art|$1,375.00||United States West Point|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~016075f654152942a8

0|47|Design for Casual Mobile Puzzle Game|I need initial design elements for a mobile puzzle game not unlike the popular Candy Crush Saga.  The theme of the game is viruses, and although this is a serious topic, the overall vibe and color scheme of the UI is supposed to be friendly and stylized.  For this assignment I need a single screen showing an example level (no menus, no animations).  The screen shows a grid with 4 different types of viruses each in 4 different colors. On the top of the screen is a level indicator as well as a score count.  The grid should contain be 7x7 tiles. Each tile has to contain one of the 16 (4x4) different virus options.  There should also be a fitting background art, either abstract or a drawing.

These guys are in another realm but from earth itself, like the multiverse. They are all hybrids of mythological legends. We wanna make them look like 85% human & 15% hybrid pinterest.com/ameentb001/hybrid-new  2. The body art of our characters are here - drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBOP_WUPziCKF9bMj6fm23Mf94BBxgIM?usp=sharing  I am writing some suggestions I want to see and what I would not like. I leave the rest to you and trust your creativity to produce something amazing for our project.   a. big guy - bigfoot descendant tribes. He is a very macho, hunky & funny character.  • I don't want to make him look too ape-y at all. I don't mind furry but not hairy. and i don't want the only chest-area-no-hair look & ape mouth. Something cool like the comic version of Sabretooth. Huge, agile & super strong.  • Some things we wanna see: - one of the powers we will give him is that his furs can become a super tough shield - he will have a scar burnt mark on his chest   b. med guy - thunderbird descendant tribes. He is a serious & short-tempered character  • Some things we wanna see: This guy will have wings, he will be a bit shorter and slimmer than Bigfoot. He inherited the lightning powers from Thunderbird too.   c. women - lochness descendant tribes. She is a calm, reserved but powerful character.  • Some things we wanna see: I attached a pic in the drive, she has lines in her body where she can bring out water from  • We will keep the gills but not the ears.  • The fins at the wrist & lats will only come out for her when she needs it   3.

0|906|Prepress photo color histogram wizard|Hello,  I am in Nice, France. I have done lots of web design and some print. I printed the following two graphics cards in China and sadly they arrived much too dark, skin tones a bit gray, etc.  I should have known better doing it on an uncalibrated monitor. I bought a new monitor, and calibrated it, but now with so many variables related to profiles and color spaces and print profiles I find it too risky on this project to guess how to proceed.  So, I need someone who can look at the images on their own calibrated display, and understand the histograms so the blacks and highlights and colors look good and not 'blown out'. The main needs are the photos of the faces of the 2 athletes on the font of the two cards (which maybe I have gotten close to correct) and then the smaller 8 photos on the back side of the card. They are the same on each card's backside.  In both cases they were too dark, and one example prints quite yellow, another too red, others blueish. (Arghhhh, it drives me a little crazy but that's why you are here :)  It seems an expert can do this in 2 hours and I would hope it could be done by end of Tuesday. Then I would walk across the street to a professional printer to view a test print on their digital offset printer.  If you wish to proceed I would send a Wetransfer link with the high-res source files not the bad ones attached here.

In order to randomise the NFT generation process, the artist must make 5 different variations of each attribute of the turtle. For example, the turtle must have 5 different smiles, and 5 different types of eyes. The attributes we are looking to include (are open to changes): eyes, hat, shell, mouth, background, stomach. Ultimately, this means that 30 variations of must be made.  We are not looking to take on any artist who is unfamiliar with NFTs.  Upon finding an artist, further information will be provided.||||Entry level|Graphic Design,Adobe Photoshop,Adobe Illustrator|$500.00|4.85|Australia Adelaide|4.85|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e216fd396cdd1f7a

0|57|Video editing company introduction|To create a video introduction that looks professional and interesting.  I have supplied two long un-edited video files along with separate audio from a microphone that will need to be synced and used. These files have a lot of re-do's but ive left everything in incase you want to clip bits and join them together.  Video length is not set but nothing too long long.  Please create a start and finish slide like in the showreel.  Feel free to be creative with the footage, maybe use elements from the showreel so its not just one long video of me, you could also split into section and have title slides... if that works.  Background audio I have picked 3 from epidemic, if you need the stems or don't like them let me know. Also, if something doesn't come across well or is too awkward let me know I can either re shoot or just take it out.  The aim of the video is just to put a face to the name and give a rough idea of what I do.  A small side note is I think video 2 has more usable stuff as I started getting use to it.  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BjPsHZfv7aPfpwusJyBceKwGpiAew9bJ?usp=sharing|$47.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Video Editing Deliverables,Explainer Video,Corporate Video/Video Editing Services,Audio Editing,Color Grading/Other,Video Editing,Adobe After Effects,Adobe Premiere Pro|$117.50|5.0|United Kingdom Bristol|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01390215bae49e255f

We do this by offering an e-commerce platform which connects owners of sites, such as municipalities of commercial real estate owners, to service providers who install devices.  We are early stage, have a working prototype and some customers.  We want to improve our website to better attract traffice, explain what we do, capture customers interest, and look professional.  There are a few elements of the required work and the vendor can provide some or all of them.  These include: (1)  Creation of an explainer video which describes what we do and captures interest.  We could describe the story and messages, and potentially provide the script too, but we need help ensuring the script makes sense, and with the end to end production process. (2)  Improvement of the website, currently hosted on WIX, to look more professional, to attract and retain the attention of customers and potential recruits, and to increase the likelihood of visitors connecting with us.  We would like advice on how this can be improved, and once scope is agreed, to have it delivered.  It's important that we, despite not being web experts, can add and maintain content ourselves.  We are open minded on whether the site should stay on WIX. (3) Search optimization, to attract more relevant visitors to our site.

And more sci-fi concepts – which are based on plausible science. Such as:    • Alcubierre Drive, Matrioshka Brain.

Some terms can be more than the 8-12 lines, and others less. I don’t want the explanation to be too specific that it goes over peoples heads – no need for technical details. My audience is general public.

0|132|Structural Engineering ~144sf Concrete Shed (simply supported)|This project is for design consideration, but we may build it. Due to our zoning we require no permits, stamps, licensing, or any liability at all on behalf of the engineer. However, it should still generally conform to code, ACI, and relevant standards. No scope creep for this project but future work likely. . It is a ~144 SF covered space made of reinforced concrete (simply supported). It's basically a box open on two sides. It looks like a culvert but it is not. Rather, it is a storage room. No trucks/vehicles, basically nothing will be on top. So the live load will be very small (only minimal based on snow/rain/workers, etc). Roof & walls will be poured at the same time so need to be limited to one concrete delivery (10 cubic yards with 10% waste = 9cy). The interior height must be about ~9 ft, and the depth 7.5 ft. Other dimensions are to be found.  See attachment for all factors.  Questions + expectations:  1) Given some required dimensions, what is the maximum interior span, if the walls & roof combined can be only ~9 cubic yards of concrete? * Note, footing & floor slab are NOT part of 9 cubic yard limit. They will be poured separate. * Please provide number and show work.  2) What is rebar layout, spacing & location? * Note: Ideally, use only #5 rebar (for all flex & temp/shrinkage) * Provide rebar sizing & layout as drawing & documentation.  3) Is shear bracing required? *  Run shear calc and provide answer with support, and relevant documentation.  4) Other comments or concerns? * Optional, but encouraged if further investigation on any aspect should be pursued||||Entry level|Structural Engineering,Civil Engineering,Reinforced Concrete Structures,Structural Analysis|$350.00|5.0|United States Phoenix|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~018bb2a87aa93223aa
0|132|Concrete Column Steel Jacket Connection Design|The subject is simple and quick to the point - existing situation is a reinforced cylindrical concrete column with 50cm diameter (and another at 70cm). Steel I Beams (IPE 300 & IPE360) are meant to be laterally supported on the subject column - however regular base plate design has been rejected by client due to increased anchor bolts (8 is too much)  The suggested connection is basically a steel jacket with 14mm thickness is supposed to be bolted into the column through 4 or 8 bolts (M20 preferred) however the anchoring must be done from 4 directions (in order to minimize centralized forces acting on column.  The plate is to surround said column with a tight fit (no gap between plate and column to be considered) and then an IPE 300 (and in another case an IPE360) is to be welded to the circular jacket. as shown in attached cad file (CAD file of screenshot displayed)  All details required and specifications are available and will be provided as needed by the designer - its a very straightforward job and all the is needed is a structural connection safety report with reasonable bolt locations and analysis.  Please note, that I would like to know the methodology by which the designer is going to make said connection.

0|405|Fix our PostgreSQL SSL Certificate Issues|We will pay a minimum of 4 hours of your published rate for this task.  We are running PostgreSQL on Ubuntu Linx on an on-premises server, serving as our corporate data warehouse.  We use both FiveTran and Stitch Data to extract data from cloud applications and load into our PostgreSQL data warehouse.    A few days ago, we started getting SSL certificate errors on both FiveTran and Stitch when they try to connect to the PostgreSQL database.  Extractions and loads were working fine before a few days ago.  These are the error messages we get: “Unable to validate certificate:  Connection Reset” (FiveTran) and “Critical SSL Syscall error:  Connection reset by peer” (Stitch Data)  We need someone to look at our current SSL certificate configuration for our PostgreSQL database and to help us troubleshoot and repair what is causing this error.  To provide you with access, we would need to coordinate a call with you, have one of our IT administrators access the server the database runs on, and then let you either guide us or share their screen with you on the remote session to work through the configuration.    This is an urgent need as our data warehouse has not refreshed in several days.  Please only reply if you have direct experience with PostgreSQL SSL configuration.  |$95.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Databases,PostgreSQL/Other,SSL,Linux|$411.67||United States Windsor|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01c7e9152bd21efea6

0|136|Non-Circumvent Clause Added to NDA|I think we have a solid mutual NDA.  I would just like to add two things to it:  1. To make it clear that it applies to both the current legal entity and any subsidiary or partner companies.  We are creating a new entity shortly that the parent company will have an equity stake in.  But it's not clear at the moment whether they will be a majority owner, and this agreement needs to protect that new company too regardless of the equity stake we end up having in it.  2. We need an additional clause that prohibits the company we are taking to from partnering with any bank or financial institution we introduce them to in any way that is competitive or cannibalizing.  Essentially we don't want them to circumvent us to create or enable competition using a strategic partner we introduced them to, unless we approve.    My hope is we can accomplish both of these with just a handful of sentences in total.  I'm hoping to get this done as soon as possible - tonight or tomorrow.

We've taken a first approach to creating a draft of this which we had a paralegal take our T&C's from our writer and editor subcontracts and amend them to the new T&C's document.  A few particular questions and goals:  1.) Is mass termination of the contracts feasible via email or does it have to be done individually?  2.) Is it enough to just have writers know that upon signing into the WordAgents platform after the contract is terminated, that they are to be bound by our new writer/editor T&C's?  Goals  1.) Eliminate Contractor Agreements Between Word Agents and Our Editors (Too cumbersome for any meaningful change-management. We have various contracts from various points in time that exist and it's not feasible for us financially or operationally to manage all these agreements individually.)  2.) Further reduce any legal liability that may arise from any claims that may be brought against WordAgents from writers/editors that are using our platform.  3.) Determine if we need to integrate some of the SPP Terms & Conditions into ours - since they are the platform that supports WordAgents.  4.)Mass terminate all contracts with our contractors once our new T&C's are approved and up on the website for writers and editors to review. (We want to send out an email just letting them know about this policy change within the business and essentially that by accessing/logging into any/all WordAgents platforms, that they agree to abide by the terms set forth in these new T&C's.  5.) Eliminate any ambiguity between contractor vs employee.

0|1473|Licensed Attorneys Needed as Panel Experts in Wage and Hour Employment Law Webinar|We are in need of three licensed attorneys with experience in labor law to be guest speakers and panel experts for a customer webinar based featuring a live question and answer session addressing recent developments in wage and hour labor laws. Our audience is small to medium-sized employers from every U.S. state (roughly 10% from California), and the roughly 60-minute webinar session includes a brief summary of recent legislative action and a 45-minute Questions and Answers period.  The introductory summary of recent developments will explore wage and hour laws categorized into three sections; wages, legislation/enforcement, and paid time off. Each expert will cover a section, submitting content for 1-2 slides and subsequently presiding over that topic’s questions during the extended Q&A session. Crossover input and opinions on topics covered by your panel expert counterparts is welcomed and encouraged overall. Although we plan to focus on these specific labor law topics (as they are the most prevalent), we expect there to be questions that will not fall into these categories. Any such questions can be answered by a volunteer panel expert or assigned impromptu.  The content submission for the 1-2 topic slides should be approximately 500 words and can include a list of key legislative developments and/or a general explanation of the topic’s impact on wage and hour laws at large. Additionally, the attorney will need to provide three bulleted tips to be used at the conclusion of the presentation.  The hired attorneys will be assigned one of the following sections to cover:  Wages • Minimum Wage & Overtime • Tipped employees • Industry-specific wage and hour requirements • City/county wage and hour • Subminimum wage • Legislation, enforcement & initiatives • Recent DOL guidance • Increased enforcement and investigator staff • Electronic records – Android and IOS timesheets • Wage and Hour Division H2B Employee Enforcement Initiative • Inflation – Consumer Price Index  Paid Time Off and Medical Leave • State and Federal PTO Laws • Existing and Expiring Covid-19 Leave • FMLA for diagnosed mental health issues • Disability Leave and other allowances   NOTE:  This list of webinar topics may evolve based on the subject matter expert’s recommendations. Any other pertinent topics addressing recent wage and hour labor law developments should be added at your discretion.  The webinars are run by us in the office and you will join us via Go-to-Webinar. We introduce you, your background, and then have an outline prepared that you would use (we run the presentation on our end). Once the introductory presentations are completed, we open it up to a Q and A session with our customers (they write in the questions, we read them to you, and you answer). Each speaker will present for approximately 5 minutes, and actively participate in the live Q&A session for the duration of the webinar, focusing on questions from their assigned wage and hour category.  Overall, if you agree to participate, it would require you to attend two rehearsals and then serve as guest speaker on the final webinar. Each of these steps takes approximately one hour. There will be minimal preparation time needed for the webinar outside of familiarizing yourself with your topic’s employer implications.  You would not need to physically be in our presence at any time. All of this is done over the phone and Internet via Go-to-Webinar.  Here is a rough schedule so you can see when about things would happen (all dates are subject to change):  Ask the Attorneys: Evolving Wage and Hour Labor Laws  Summary Content Due (Attorneys) – Friday, September 30 Outline Written (by us internally)  – Thursday, October 6 Presentation (Created by us internally from legal brief)  – Thursday, October 6 Practice 1 (all) – Thursday, October 13  (11:00 - 12:00 noon Pacific Time) Practice 2 (all) - Tuesday, October 18 (11:00 - 12:00 noon Pacific Time) Live Webinar (all) – Thursday, October 20 (11:00 -12:00 noon Pacific Time)  Practices, as well as the live webinar are held on West Coast time (PST or PDT).
