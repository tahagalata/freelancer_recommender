Either do the valuation directly or research individuals or companies to evaluate the worth of my product and all the other items associated with the product.    If you don't want to do valuation; then you only need to put in touch with the right people or companies; presumably business brokers or similar entities.  It is helpful, but not required to have a background in medical devices, healthcare and FDA regulatory affairs.   To this end, the individual tasks are: 1. Reach out to anyone you can find and make inquiries 2. Explain the background and see if they can do an evaluation and obviously gather all the details about the valuation (Cost, Time, Details, etc.) 3. Either do the valuation or find the proper entity to do it.  I will provide any technical background they require.  Background  I have a medical device that is ready to sell. It has all of these attributes: • Fully patented (not patent pending) • FDA 510k clearance to sell the device as a prescription device (510k Rx) • FDA 510k clearance to sell the device Over the Counter (510k OTC) • Manufacturing has been established. The device is manufactured via injection mold and the mold has been manufactured.  Up to 1M units can be produced in a short amount of time. • There is a website (under construction) run by a medical marketing professional and is available (if desired) • The patent and all the submissions / updates / filings are up to date with the patent attorneys.  I believe the first 4 bullets hold the value, the last two are there for completeness.|$75.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Business Analysis & Strategy Skills,Business Valuation|$262.50||United States San Diego|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013a7d727fa7409c46

The second round of funding will be for year 2 onwards, amounting to $160m.

0|1740|Grant Researcher, Writer, Editor|Hello! Our nonprofit organization, USA Green Communities, was founded in Santa Barbara, CA in 2010, by a former mayor of Santa Barbara and pioneer of the environmental movement, Hal Conklin, who was instrumental in the establishment of what is now Earth Day, following a massive oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel in 1969. Our flagship project is a Green Products Database of independently certified green products and services. With a $500,000 grant from Wells Fargo, Phase One of the project was completed prior to the pandemic (and Hal's passing last year as a result of a brain tumor), and the database currently contains over 120,000 certified products. Our goal is 200,000+ products, and is inspired by a similar project (though much smaller) in South Korea, which also includes a green credit card that provides incentives and points for sustainable purchasing to over 18-million users. We recently received unsolicited interest in our database by the head of product sustainability for the largest online retailer on the planet (guess who?). Since the database is owned by our nonprofit organization, which funds development of the database through an independent contractor, we need to raise $1.3-million over the next 12 months to complete the project. Grants will be key to achieving this goal. The organization has deep roots and connections locally and nationally, and we believe that there is certainly sufficient support out there for this project. We would be looking to apply for grants at the 25k-500k levels. Much of the copy for this project has been written, via a 12-page Program/Business Plan.

0|1740|Local PR Professional Needed|Hey guys!  Thanks for taking the time to read this job post.  We run an SEO agency and are looking to package together something for our local clients that includes SEO, social, and local PR with a link building focus.  For local PR, here's a scalable angle I'm working on that we can continue to use for clients everywhere, even if they share a market.  I call it the “Do Good and Do Well” campaign.  Basically, on the consult call with a client, we ask them what sucks in their market.  They’ll say something like “oh the homeless issue man. I hate that these people have to…” whatever. We find a problem in their community they’re passionate about fixing.  Then, we find a very basic, small way they can help. So for covid that would have been giving away masks early on.  Once we’ve found a problem and an affordable way to implement a solution, we consult them through that, build a page for it on their website with some sharable graphics or video content, and pitch local journalists stories with headlines formatted like this:  “Local Business Giving Away SOLUTION To Help With PROBLEM”  Initial research can be done to find out what problems local news outlets are talking about so we can map this type of thing to their audience's interests as well.  It’d be a hyper-relevant way to get local backlinks.  I'm looking for someone who can help manage this kind of effort for our agency. This means I need someone with experience in local PR, but project management, communication, management, and recruitment skills are a huge plus.  Looking forward to speaking with you!|$50.00|More than 30 hrs/week|More than 6 months||Public Relations,Media Relations,Content Writing,Search Engine Optimization,link building,Writing,Social Media Marketing|$3,466.68|5.0|United States Orange Park|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0195151de03c9bebbf

Beyond a lifestyle of doing less bad, but stepping into doing more good, being a vector of regeneration, a participant in direct restoration of ecology, community and local economy. My thesis revolves around eco-villages participating in regenerative micro-industry as being a critical long term solution that will be relevant beyond immediate technological mitigations. I have a broad qualitative argument for why people living in eco-villages being paid to create regenerative life giving systems is fundamental, for one, taking folks out of endless cycles of self soothing through consumerism into a life of purpose and connection. I am building a fractally scalable toolbox and process for building regenerative communities. Come help lay the stones that other can build from, build a world that we are happy to live in a proud to hand down.  In many cases my proposals are logical next steps for supply chain and manufacturing, but I need to strengthen the part of the argument that is most core to my purpose, climate, ecology, social etc.  For now I need to focus on unpacking carbon sequestration and climate change into its sub-pieces like soil regeneration, biodiversity, circular supply chains etc.  You are a researcher who has previous experience in climate research and can feel a magnetism to what I am describing. You are a critical thinker who can find blindspots and identify credible resources.  I Eli, am an inventor, entrepreneur, and decentralized systems architect.

0|365|Virtual Assistant - Ebay Lister|Job Title: Ebay Lister Job Responsibilities: Data Entry, Create Ebay Listings, Price Research, and Determine Shipping Costs for Shoes (priced $80 to $95 - everything else is free shipping) Required Applicant Qualities: Must need VPN to access US-based websites such as eBay, Access to Google Drive, and English language proficiency to communicate effectively Desired Applicant Qualities: Excellent communication skills, Willingness to learn, the Ability to follow clearly defined instructions, prior eBay listing experience, knowledge of eBay fees  Tools Necessary: Virtual Assistant will need access to a gmail account so files can be sent back and forth and so spreadsheets can be shared via google accounts, a VPN so he/she can access US-based sites, and a chat service we can communicate via,  the eBay app, smart phone, and computer/laptop.  Two Main Job Responsibilities: Logging Buy Costs & Listing on eBay  Logging Buy Costs - To start, you will be sent receipts and purchase orders daily that you must log into a shared Google Spreadsheet. The total cost, and any cash-back savings will be included. Everyday I would like you to spend an hour just logging all of those purchase costs into a shared Google spreadsheet so we can both use that information for pricing items.  After an hour of logging buy costs, you will list for 2-3 hours for a total of 3-4 hours per day of work total.  Listing on eBay - You will be sent all of the photographs of the items, descriptions to use for specific items, and you will even be told what to price at to start (but eventually you will have to price items yourself).  When creating listings you must always start by knowing your buy cost and then searching for sold comps to get an idea of value. If the item is not profitable after estimating fees and shipping then just let me know. After the value is established and the item is indeed profitable, you will create a new listing by clicking the button “sell one like this” on a sold listing that looks professional. This way you can save a lot of time by using the information from that listing, but obviously you must double check that the information is accurate!  From there, your job will be to use all of that information from the photographs I provided to determine a detailed and well-put title for each item, to copy & paste the appropriate description, and to determine what to price based on sold listings. You must also go through the item specifics to ensure they are all correct (i.e. a softcover book may be mistakenly listed as hardcover) and also add any main details as possible but I stay away from most of the minor item specifics. You will use free shipping for most listings besides shoes valued over $75 and less than $90 dollars because shoes over $74.99 are required to use a standard $15 Fedex Label and go through authentication. To avoid that  and save the buyer shipping time we price a shoe valued at 90 as $74.95 with flat $10 shipping cost. Or a pair of shoes that is valued at 80 would be $69.95 with flat $10 shipping. Always end prices in .95 or .49 to keep it uniform!  If these steps are followed exactly, you should be able to list upwards of 20 listings per hour if not more as I average 20-30/hour.  Proof of Work- I will be able to monitor your progress as you log the buy costs and I will surely double check each eBay listing, but to further shown the work has been done, at the end of each task I will require you to just zoom out and send me a screenshot or two of the spreadsheet showing the logged buy costs. Also, to show you had listed on eBay you will either screenshot or send a screen recording scrolling through all of  the listings you had completed for the day.||Less than 30 hrs/week|More than 6 months|Intermediate|Virtual Assistance,eBay Listing,Data Entry,Product Listings,Email Communication|$10.00|5.0|United States Hellertown|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01414c49e8d36d4520

In addition to finding companies for the directory, I need help developing a data taxonomy that will allow users to easily search and filter results not only based on business details (including logo), but also industry, type of services offered (tech, professional services, both), area of specialization (one law versus another), hosting, etc. In performing this part of the analysis, I would appreciate your review of other software directories to get ideas for additional information that we might be able to compile.  I've used a few data mining tools (Crunchbase, scrapers, etc.) to compile the existing list but am open to others if you have suggestions. I suspect if we expand the universe of regulated industries (healthcare, cannabis, etc.), we can identify another 1,000-1,500 companies.  To be successful at this project, I need you to research regtech and develop a deep understanding of the industries served and the nuance between their services. Since this is being compiled for a directory, precise business classification and data structure/organization is critical for this work. If you apply, please describe your current understanding of regtech and generally how you plan to research it further.

We seek a researcher to catalogue the estimated 1,000 programs, initiatives and organizations currently administering nature-rich interventions to veterans and active-duty service members suffering from PTSD, TBI and other conditions.  Background: Following wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, American troops returned to the United States suffering from PTSD and TBI in unprecedented numbers. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), charged with caring for military veterans, lacked effective interventions to address these conditions. Studies conducted as part of the Green Road Project and the Naval Medical Center’s Surf and Hike Therapy trial indicated that nature-rich interventions such as hiking, surfing, hunting and angling provided more successful outcomes than traditional (pharmaceutical) interventions, but they did not gain widespread adoption with the VA.  Frustrated with the VA’s interventions, many veterans began taking matters into their own hands, founding nonprofit organizations that incorporated nature-rich interventions into programming that benefited their peers. Problematically, little coordination between these nonprofit organizations exists, resulting in fragmentation, siloing and lack of communication between natural allies.  The development of a database to catalogue the myriad initiatives currently underway will assist with standardization of protocols, establishment of best practices, shared results and communications among principals. This in turn will provide value to veterans, the VA, the Department of Defense and its responsibilities to provide continuity of care for active duty service members as they transition to civilian life.|||1 to 3 months||Data Entry,Writing,Researcher|$150.00|5.0|United States Jackson|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01d78fad6263e1335d

The content of the audio is sometimes explicit, and sometimes contains explanations of, or conversations about potentially sensitive topics such as: domestic violence, alcohol consumption, assault, car accidents, etc.  These files are already transcribed with a standard format, and simply need to be reviewed for word-level accuracy and punctuation. Timestamps do not need to be reviewed. We will deliver the files to you and provide you with the applicable transcription standard conventions used by our partner so that you can identify and correct mistakes. You will be expected to make edits within the transcript, and deliver the edited transcripts to us to complete the task. We hope that you already have access to a preferred transcription software for use during this project. If not, Notepad++, while basic, is sufficient to complete this task.  Based on our experience auditing a batch of English transcripts in-house, we expect this task to take between 10 and 20 hours to complete. This can be divided into milestones if desired.||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/Transcription Types,Audio Transcription/Other,Quebec French Dialect,French,Quality Assurance|$627.75|5.0|United States Scottsdale|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e0c56c6f4811797d

We sell our services to companies which recruit international professionals.  To increase our brand awareness on our market, we regularly write and publish articles and ebooks. Mostly in English, but sometimes the first version is in French. In that case we have to translate them into English for our nonFrench audience.  Today, we want to hire a freelancer, who will be in charge of those translations.  Price: when benchmarking, I've found that the average cost per word translated is around $0.045. Would this price be okay for you?  I've seen your profile and reviews on Upwork, and I would like to try a collaboration with you. Do you have availabilities in the coming days for a first article?

The deliverable is a collection of screen recordings and screenshots for each of the 18 sites that are needed.  (There's also another Upwork job for the SELLING experience – feel free to look at that too.)  We are looking for someone with an eye for UX so they can call out and document particularly effective or poor examples of UX.  // Background We are building a Shopify-based platform to make resale easier for small to medium-sized fashion brands be more sustainable. We are beginning to get into the details of the UX flows for buying+selling secondhand items and want to understand all the patterns already being used. This keeps us from re-inventing the wheel and shows us places we can do better.  // Project details + deliverables There are 18 sites we've identified as interesting to us. For each site, you will act as a customer looking for a used item and go through the buying process – up to checkout – noting specific things (more below).  1. Start a screen recording 2. Click through the site as if you're browsing around – imagine you're not sure what to buy but you want something. 3. Look at some specific products paying particular attention to the way new and used items are presented. 4. Choose two items to purchase and add them to your cart. 5. Go through the checkout process as far as possible without adding a credit card. Create an account, if necessary.  Format of deliverables: 1. A screen recording of the whole process (your choice of software, e.g. Loom.com or QuickTime) 2. Screenshots of the following pages: Homepage, Product List page, Product Details page, all the checkout pages. 3. Separate screenshots (might be duplicates of the above) but with callouts for:     • Assurances of authenticity, guarantees or anything else that's intended to give the buyer confidence.     • Item condition.     • Seller reputation. 4. Put the video and screenshots in a folder, name it with the brand's name, and upload it to a Google Drive folder that will be shared with you.  ❗️Be sure to capture the whole length of the page when clipping screenshots – Firefox has a page clipper built-in or you can download a Chrome extension. ❗️Name files ""[Brand]-[Page]-[anything else].png""  // About us We’re a startup in the fashion space building a ""resale-as-a-service"" platform that enables any brand to accept clothing back and offer credit to customers, incentivizing them to keep garments out of landfills. Our first product is a Shopify App that plugs into existing e-commerce stores.  // Time commitment Each site should take no more than 20min.

Formulas are only included in Row 10 of the first worksheet and Row 9 of the second worksheet as this was an unfinished project.  To give you an idea of how I want this to flow, I want to start out asking for client details (name, production year, type of farm, etc.)  Based on those answers, they will need to complete different subsections of the form.  Each section will also have main questions as to what type of commodities were grown or marketed, and based on those answers, they will need to complete all the production information.  So basically, I want clients to provide the same information they need to provide on the files attached.  However, I want it to be more of a question and answer thing, and to only make them answer the parts of the survey/questionnaire that are relevant to their situation.||||Intermediate|Jotform,PDF||4.25|Canada Meaford|4.25|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0165ef1dd0cc048496

Conceptually, we are looking:   1.  to have a button or something like that as in shown in Cell B2 of the worksheet called Conntrolboard in the Financial Dashboard file. When pressed, the script would look into each file listed in Column A of the Controlboard and compile all the contents as shown in the sheet called InvestmentsCompiled.  2a. Further combine the data in the InvestmentsCompiled sheet into the Performance sheet. Columns A-D of the Performance sheet is effectively a pivot table of the data in InvestmentsCompiled. Columns E-G are formulas that can be reused. Column G is a concatenation of the Notes in each row that is combined as part of the pivot table.     2b. implement the dropdown shown in cell A1 of the Performance sheet that filters the data in InvestmentsCompiled based on one or more labels before that data gets pivot tabled.  3a. Implement the Portfolio table other than column F, which again is a pivot table from the InvestmentsCompiled sheet.  Column F of Portfolio is a hard one to implement and requires the LabelsCompiled and IRR per Label sheets that we will implement later.    3b. Implement a dropdown as shown in cell A1 of the Portfolio table that filters the rows of the InvestmentsCompiled to a subset of dates before that data gets pivot tabled.  I am listing this as a One Time Project but this is the first part of an at least three part project. Part 2 would be the IRR per Label calculations. Part 3 would be the creation of a dashboard. Part 4 could be the implementation of additional controls in the Controlboard.|||||/Platform Expertise,Google Sheets/Scripting & Automation Deliverables,Scripting|$300.00|5.0|United States Mountain View|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/01JpsCKH4-Okee0hKMy8hFEFazv1AmGidGoUkneRRdQUg=

I need it set up by employee name and each employee would have a list of 4 KPI measurements.  HR will then put a score of .25 /.5 / .75 or 1 if the employee meet that particular KPI.   In the back of the spreadsheet we would set a dollar amount say $500 towards that KPI.  If the employee only got .5 on that measurement they would only get $250 bonus for that particular KPI.      4 total KPI measurements per person.  Once I have the excel sheet I would duplicate it for other people, so one spreadsheet per person.  The .25 / .5 / .75 /1 etc etc would populate to a graph page with pictures and dollar amounts of the employee bonus amount for that month.  I would like the excel sheet to be very detailed and picture driven for the employee point of view with graphs we can copy and paste and send to them.|||||Microsoft Excel|$40.00||United States Branson|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e4f54172249e878b

0|1637|Scraper for creditcards.com|Here is a link to a number of popular Cashback credit cards in alphabetical order: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/cash-back/?orderby=product.name&order=ASC  When you go to one of these cards and hit Read Full Review you get the following link for a given credit card: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/amazon-prime-rewards-visa-signature-card-review/?reviewCategory=cash-back  On this Amazon Prime Visa card for instance we need to scrape the following things (ideally output these into a table with the following variables):  Name (Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card) Rewards Rate  (5% back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods purchases, 2% back on restaurant, gas station and drug store purchases, 1% back on other purchases) Sign-up Bonus ($100 Amazon Gift Card) Annual Bonus ($0) *Note they say ‘none’ instead of $0, we can collect it as ‘none’ however and clean it up manually to say $0 afterwards* Annual Fee ($0)  (we don’t need APR info, pros, cons, other features, etc. for now)  There are additional variables we need to scrape as well that may be present for some cards but not others. For example on the American Express Cash Magnet® Card: https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/american-express-cash-magnet-card-review/?reviewCategory=cash-back  We need to collect the same info as above, like:   Name Rewards Rate Introductory Bonus *Note that they call it ‘Introductory Bonus’ here while in the previous example they called it ‘Sign-up Bonus’ - essentially the same thing* Annual Fee  Now in the introductory bonus we need to make sure we scrape the entire thing - not just the $200 piece but also the accompanying information “if you spend $2,000 in first 6 months”   We need to do this for all of the cards found in the first link in this doc. Be sure to keep clicking the “Show More Results” button to get all of the cards in that link.  Now that link is only targeted to the subset of cards that are flagged as good for Cashback. To capture full breadth of cards, we also need the scraper to conduct the same operation to all of these links as well:  https://www.creditcards.com/rewards-cards/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/business/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/airline/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/luxury/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/low-interest/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/hotel/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/credit-building/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/students/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/rewards/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/retail/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/no-annual-fee/ https://www.creditcards.com/reviews/travel/   *Note: Some cards may be duplicative across these links, please avoid duplication||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Data Extraction Deliverables,Data Extraction/Other,Data Scraping,Web Crawling|$60.00||United States New York|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01afa3086f4344eeb4

Please reply ""I can totally help"" so I know you're not a bot.  There should be a big button on the left in the ""Export"" worksheet a user can click and upon click, the following happens:  1) Look at the first 10 characters of each worksheet within the larger workbook and extract the matching ones to a new worksheet  2) Go to the ""Actuals"" tab within the new workbook and find the grand total of the pivot table (Column E). If there's no data in the pivot table, skip to step below.  3) Show the details for the cell containing the Total (double click) as a new worksheet and rename it from sheetX to ""Data"" and place it last in the new workbook  4) Save the workbook to the DESKTOP as the name of the worksheet before the text ""Summary"" and have the naming convention in cell ""=Export!D2"" following it. E.g. ""Bestbuy.com Jan - June Budget Summary 7.15.22""  5) Repeat this process until all worksheets and their matching pairs in the main workbook are saved.

There could 40+ of these, so the macro should cycle through and repeat until all matching sheets have been exported to a new workbook and saved with instructions and naming convention above.

From this database, we want to obtain a periodic statistics table to obtain the performance of each of our sales representatives over the last 8 days.  The table will therefore have to update automatically each day to display only the statistics of the last 8 days.  Example: On March 04, I would like to see the percentage of Tanguy's sales from 25/02 to 04/03 included.  On this same table, on 05/03 the stats will then be automatically calculated from 26/02 inclusive to 05/03 inclusive, without any manipulation on our part.  You can consult the structure of our database in attachment to this announcement.  We will share with you, if you wish, more details on our database following your response to this announcement.  ==FR==  Nous recherchons activement une personne maîtrisant l’outil Google Sheet enfin de réaliser le projet suivant :  Nous avons une base de données dans une feuille Google Sheet qui contient des informations sur les appels de nos commerciaux vers nos prospects (Appel Non Décroché, Vente Effectuée lors de l’appel, Rappel Programmé…).  À partir de cette base de données, nous voulons obtenir un tableau de statistique périodique pour obtenir les performances de chacun de nos commerciaux sur les 8 derniers jours.

0|573|Data scientist to help with developing career recommendation model|Hi Data Scientists,  I am looking for a talented data scientist to work with me clarify and run an existing career recommendation model that matches a survey with job data and ranks it.  The survey and data all available - what is really needed is someone who understands algorithms and can code-up a simple model that can accept a survey response and produce an output afterwards.  I am particularly interested in someone who is strong in maths and algorithms and has at least basic excel and excellent R tidyverse skills.  Once the model is clarified and running, I would like to work on a second job based on improving it.  Tasks: 1. Kick-off conversation with me so I can explain the model in more detail 2. Understand how the model works from end to end 3. Rebuild the model in a more simple, structured and tidy way (in Excel and R tidyverse) 4. Develop the model so that a survey can be taken by anyone and results can be automatically seen (in Excel and R) 5. Evaluate and test the current algorithm and scope other possible algorithms that could be used instead 6. Enhance the output of the model by for example showing not just ranked results but allowing for making adjustments to weightings to change results and also showing why the result were obtained (i.e. what survey responses drive the result across tasks, personality and other vs the typical result - why are you different than others)  Details on the model, the survey and data are attached below.  How the model works so far 1. This is a career recommendation model that matches a short survey (attached) with job-related task data (also attached dataset) with jobs to rank best-suited jobs. 2. You can follow how the model works in Excel Power Query by opening the excel file, clicking data - workbook queries and clicking on the various modelling blocks (e.g. 'Model'). 3. The model looks at 5 categories - career area, personality, education/experience and aptitude – and gives them equal weighting 100 points. 4. A person takes survey and answers questions with responses (from 1 to 10) for 83 questions across four areas of career area (33 questions), personality (6 questions), education/experience (2 questions) and aptitudes (41 questions). 5. There is also a score for each question in each job provided by psychologists to measure how much it represents that job. Using these psychologist scores, the four areas are rescaled to be worth 100 points each and then multiplied by 6, 2, 1 and 3 respectively to give effective weights of career area (100), personality (200), education/experience (100) and aptitudes (400). 6. These scores are then summed for each career and ranked and displayed in a list.||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||Data Science,Data Analysis,Statistics,Data Modeling,R coding|$120.00|5.0|Ireland Dublin|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01fff7e6ad3a766b12

For example, If a client answers question 1  = size 6.5 question 2 = wide width question 3 = bunions, then the recommendation (ending) should be 36 extra wide, with a link to this collection in my store.  But, if the answer to question 1  = size 6.5 question 2 = medium width question 3 = no issues, then the recommendation (ending) should be 36 medium, with a link to this collection in my store.

0|9|Data visualization developer to create interactive visualization for web|Hi there,  We need high quality data vis developer to help us create an interactive visualisation.  This is a small initial job, which we envisage to be a few days' work, that then might require some ongoing support.  In summary, we want to create a dual axis visualisation that combines 2x datasets.  You can see the examples here of the 2 charts we want to plot.  These are created in Flourish using their off-the-shelf tools: Dataset A: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8048171/ Dataset B: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8048695/  The aim is to combine these into one chart:  the cases as a line chart on one y-axis, incidents as stacked area on the other line.    We also want to plot a few annotations onto the graph, which will highlight some key events.   We also want to have the filter options, so users can filter by country and possibly turn data on/off. There should be similar type animation/interaction as shown in the Flourish examples.  The output visualisation will need to be embedded into Wordpress.  We want to be able to easily update the data and create versions for different regions (there will be 4 main regions, plus individual country versions).  We will provide the datasets. We will supply a combined visual of how we envisage the final chart looking (which is more for colour/font references)  We are open to the framework used, but we need to be able to update the data easily. Embedding into WP pages should be straightforward (using div or iframe).   When you respond, please can you clearly explain: -what framework/tool you'll use -how long it will take and your rates (budget provided is guide) -how we can manage the data easily to create other versions -what kind of support you can provide + turnaround times for initial project (when can you start, how long you think it'll take) -provide examples of similar work you've done  We are a small design team.

The course is for Californians 55+ and helps them become safer drivers while saving hundreds of dollars on their car insurance. In addition to the short video, we would like you to take these 3 images (attached). It won't be a suit, but a more casual look.  Background for character: you're a grandparent with two grandsons who visit you every weekend. you love taking them on long drives in your Cadillac deVille and you love your grandsons a lot. however, as a 62 year old, you feel your reflexes and driving skills are not the same anymore. its natural because that comes with aging (eyesight reduced, hearing not the same, you've forgotten defensive driving techniques, and maybe not kept up with the newest car technologies). You feel bad because you want to keep your grandsons safe but it's also an ego issue. Through a lot of searching you find our course which is approved by the California DMV. You learn to be a safer driver while saving hundreds of dollars on your car insurance every year.  1. Take those 3 images in a similar setting  2. We have a script ready - so we need a 20-30 second video that you can take on your phone - like a selfie video. Similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTRj39qdlmg.  3. You would need to sign a NDA and a rights release so that we can use your image/video freely for marketing purposes. This is our website: https://trafficsafetyinstitute.com/  Here's the script:  Hi, I’m Joe Philips, I’m 62 and I’m a grandpa! If you're older than 55 and have a driving license, please watch this 30-second video till the end! My favorite part of the weekend is driving my grandkids around town in my Cadillac deVille! They LOVE it! But… even saying this out loud hurts my ego, so bear with me… I’m aware that my driving skills and reflexes are not what they were 20 years ago… That’s it, I said it! I admit, even though it hurts every cell in my body, I admit: my eyesight is not the same, my reflexes are way slower, and even my hearing has weakened… Under no circumstance would I admit such things, let alone make it public, but can really pride and ego outweigh the safety of my grandkids? If you're older than 55 and have a driving license, click the button below to see what I did to polish my driving skills, save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance and most importantly make weekend rides with my grandkids safer than ever!||Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/Age,Senior Adult/Other,Male,Acting,US English Dialect,Middle-Aged Adult|$275.00|5.0|United States Pasadena|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a7f56d039d4ce951

0|507|Rebranding/Logo design for fitness based physical therapy|Hello! I am looking for someone to help me rebrand/create a new logo for me. I run a physical therapy clinic that is fitness-forward, and performance-based. The previous name was FarrNorth Performance and Rehab (my last name is Farr and I live in Alaska) and I am changing it to Tier XI Training and Rehab.  Why? Tier XI (eleven) being above top level, higher than 10, as we expect to exceed expectations and provide the highest quality care. Also, XI being symbolic of renewal and awakening after the most challenging personal year I have had.  I want the logo to represent strength and resilience in life, but also have a slight feminine component as I am the owner and sole practitioner and want to ensure my fellow females feel proud and comfortable supporting my brand and business.  Attached is my previous logo. I don’t want it to be too generic, since I’m not a chain or franchise of physical therapy clinics and more mom+pop style.  Really looking forward to working with someone to share my passion in my logo and dream of being a self employed small business owner.  Cheers!

This is a one-time job for now but any talented designer, graphics or otherwise, I'll certainly keep in touch with and potentially use in the future for graphic presentations to clients.  The company needs business cards, letterhead, a physical stamp for various items (approved, received, denied, business letters, etc) and a few other things typical to a creative industry that I don't currently have the time to do myself since my own architectural workload is a little full at the moment. I've attached the current two logos, and some sample work we do so that you can understand the style of design we hold.  Ideally, if you could submit samples of your past work or the proposed design to me with your submittal it'd be appreciated. I WILL NOT take any of your work, as a designer I know how important our intellectual property is, but am asking for something so I can pick the right designer and work with them.  Working jointly on the design you submitted, to fine-tune the design of the logo and branded items.  I cannot pay much now but this will be a good portfolio builder as you'll always be able to claim you branded an architectural firm, and there is potential repeat business in the deal for the right person come presentation time to clients.  My website, which is under construction, is wakedesign.org and for that matter, if you'd like to offer up web design assistance let's talk about that too.  Thank you.

0|859|3 Brand-aligned Designs/Fine Art for Shirts|"Hello Artists!  We are seeking new illustrations / designs for our retail line. We're establishing the brand re-fresh with the below aesthetic guidelines.  Currently the focus is new designs for t-shirt/tanks on unisex and women's blanks.  We'd like to start with 3 different but aligned designs, with option to re-hire for more since we'll need about 10 total for our next run.  BACKGROUND: The brand (Melrose Moto) was built out of our busy motorcycle service shop, which extended into gear sales and now everyday apparel. We are on a busy boulevard attracting a mix of non-riding individuals as well as moto enthusiasts and avid riders. The shop has a classic, dark wood design, tin tiled ceiling, plays classic rock, displays clothing with metal piping, housing casual but fashionable fits and fabrics for men and women.  GOAL: 1) Grab non-riding shoppers off the street using less motorcycle specific designs (we have a hand full of motorcycle art on shirts already) and more cross over themes. 2) Build our 'look' with the below brand guides which carve out our own space against our competitors.    NEEDED: ROUND ONE is a total of 3 new illustration designs. - 2 brand-aligned designs that use cross-over themes of freedom, open road, moving     forward, taking the wheel, adventure, peace of mind, - 1 new moto-inspired design.  Style of art we like: -line-design -fine art soft brush paint -sketch / charcoal  *NO* skulls/eagles/flags/comic cartoons/harley themes/rocker/goth   *****MELROSE MOTO BRAND GUIDES***** VISUAL EXAMPLES ATTACHED AS A STARTING GUIDE ONLY  Color & Style: -golds -deep red/blue/green -1920/30s art / bikes -regal -classic lean fonts -soft brush/poster art (see images attached)  *we don't need to use our past logos  Main Themes/Symbols/Targets:  1) Industrial-creative era: wheels/gadgets/bike parts/the-making-of/building/locomotives, riders that value mechanics, bikes are works of art. Symbols of the industrial era & Renaissance men/women.  2) Early century racer bikes, track winners, famous races  3) Transport /Magic- freedom, serenity, desert, mountain scenes, open, possibilities, journey. dreamers. 'City of Dreams'. 'Magic Metropolis'.  Additional outlier theme: (take a stab only if this excites you/ is your forte) 4) 90s inspired  (VHS/cassette/famous tv shows/characters/cars) but minimal. Vibrant secondary blues/purples/pinks - 80s 90s fonts and more generic slogans.  LOGO/SLOGAN OPTIONS: If desired, words to use, not necessary. We don't want to add our logo to everything: ""Melrose Moto"", ""Melrose Ave"", ""Melrose Motorcycle Company"". ""Never Quit"" ""Carpe Dium"" ""Head Up"" ""Do It"" ""Keep On"" ""Facing Forward"" ""Forward Motion"" “The places you'll go"" ""Go Outside"" ""Go Your Own Way"" ""Make Your Mark"" ""Come Together""  If applying these, we'd like to see with and without words.

I am working on a cover for my book, but this piece is extra special to me as it is of a vision of my daughter I lost. So I plan on having this piece also framed in my home.  This book is a Christian memoir, and this vision is an essential piece to this book as it is to my heart. It doesn’t need to be a very big piece, maybe an 8x10. But there needs to be detailed to my vision.  There maybe other projects from this later as well.

0|859|Need an outstanding mural designed for our new coworking space!|"We are creating a small office rental and coworking space that primarily caters to entrepreneurs and artists. We have 22 individual offices plus a larger coworking room where we will have people who would like to work in a shared space or artists looking for a temporary studio space. The key demographic here is startup business owners/entrepreneurs , independent artists, or the type of people that frequent Starbucks to try and get some work down out of the house. Since we are targetting entrepreneurial and creative types, the mural should be enticing to this demographic as well as to city officials.  We plan on partnering with local art classes to see if we can involve local middle and high school art students, so we need a top notch artist to design a mural we can then give to local painters to put on the wall.  The name of the building is ""Historic Jonesboro Executive Offices and Coworking""  The wall is divided by two columns, creating 3 potential canvas areas. The mural can either be three individual but related designs, or one large design for the entire wall, with or without use of columns. We are open to any creative ideas you might have. The wall is primarily brick, so that should be taken into consideration with amount of detail in the design. We would very much like to keep the brick texture of the wall. Ideally a lighter color scheme should be used as well, as we do not what to make the room look ""smaller"" with too many dark colors.  We only have two creative requirements:  1) The mural MUST be a mural focused on Jonesboro, Georgia, USA. Jonesboro is located just south of Atlanta, Georgia. The building is located in the heart of Jonesboro in the historic district, so the mural MUST be about Jonesboro.  Ideally, the mural will include cultural aspects of the city as well. Given the name of the building, we want to lean into the history and culture of the city. It can include past, present, or future themes of the city, or any notable citizens you may come across. Additional inclusions can come from Clayton County, Georgia as well, which is where Jonesboro is located, but again, the main focus should be the city itself. Bottom line, if the mural design does not have a major focus on Jonesboro, GA then it will not be considered.  2) The movie Gone With The Wind (filmed in Jonesboro) should NOT be a primary focus of the mural. It can be included in some MINOR elements, but we do not want it to be a Gone with the Wind mural. There are already plenty of those in Jonesboro. So, it's an overdone concept.  There is also a new park and government complex being constructed close by, called Lee Street Park and Amphitheatre, which could also be a good inclusion. Basically, we are looking for something that would make residents of Jonesboro and the city council proud.  The mural can be thought provoking or a little provocative if you choose. Clayton County has a checkered past and historical issues with racism, but obviously we don't want anything to be too critical of the city or county. The city and county are also experiencing a large demographic shift with African Americans being the largest source of population growth, so this should be taken into account either in design itself or considerations for what not to include. Our tenant base is also majority African American.  Finally, if not already included, the design should also include a full release for our use and distribution, and to be recreated on our wall as a mural.  Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the city or its history as I do not live close by and haven't had much time to investigate, so I won't be much help in providing historical or cultural ideas at the moment.

0|859|ISO Incredible Artist for digital art, painting and logo|My business is life coaching as a specialist in trauma. I use many modalities and tools to work with my clients and get to the root of their trauma.(yes this is all relevant tit he project, keep reading)  Through the healing process comes empowerment and out of the empowerment comes purpose, direction, understanding, energy renewal and the confidence needed to rebuild and recreate. I help my clients obtain and work toward their life’s purpose, break old habits that no longer serve and reach for the highest potential self.  The name of my website is The Lotus and The Lion. There is a long story behind the name but to simplify it, it’s another representation of yin and yang, light and dark, soft and small, big and strong. Both the lotus and the lion individually are very symbolic throughout ancient history. Symbols of enlightenment, strength, power, effortless thriving..:you get it.  I am also a Mayan Astrologer and use this ancient wisdom and marry it with today’s science of the mind, the body and emotions.  Now for the project, currently the website has a photo of me on the front and my son is still in the creation process but it’s close to done. It just needs the art and a logo to complete.  I think a timeless art piece rich in symbolism, incorporating the cholq’ij (Mayan calendar), the Lion, the lotus with a feeling of healing, universal keys, strength, empowerment and gratitude is the feelings that I’m going for. I would love to have an actual painting of it in my studio and a digital version on the website.  Over time I expect this project to evolve into something much larger than just coaching. Public speaking, retreats, workshop events, a shop and  books are all to come in the future which could mean more work for the artist if I’m happy with the result.  I originally had the thought of a Lion standing at the foot of a lotus pond staring into the water and what he sees back instead of his own reflection is a lotus. I feel it shows that we aren’t always what we project to the world and that the toughest exteriors can have a soft interior. Though I’m not stuck on that vision and still open to ideas.  Looking forward someone who can paint and also convert the actual painting into digital art. I’m interested either way.  Also looking for a simple logo and possible branding....||||Intermediate|/Analog Art Types,Painting/Other,Graphic Design,Branding,Logo Design,Digital Art|$1,375.00||United States West Point|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~016075f654152942a8

0|47|Design for Casual Mobile Puzzle Game|I need initial design elements for a mobile puzzle game not unlike the popular Candy Crush Saga.  The theme of the game is viruses, and although this is a serious topic, the overall vibe and color scheme of the UI is supposed to be friendly and stylized.  For this assignment I need a single screen showing an example level (no menus, no animations).  The screen shows a grid with 4 different types of viruses each in 4 different colors. On the top of the screen is a level indicator as well as a score count.  The grid should contain be 7x7 tiles. Each tile has to contain one of the 16 (4x4) different virus options.  There should also be a fitting background art, either abstract or a drawing.

These guys are in another realm but from earth itself, like the multiverse. They are all hybrids of mythological legends. We wanna make them look like 85% human & 15% hybrid pinterest.com/ameentb001/hybrid-new  2. The body art of our characters are here - drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBOP_WUPziCKF9bMj6fm23Mf94BBxgIM?usp=sharing  I am writing some suggestions I want to see and what I would not like. I leave the rest to you and trust your creativity to produce something amazing for our project.   a. big guy - bigfoot descendant tribes. He is a very macho, hunky & funny character.  • I don't want to make him look too ape-y at all. I don't mind furry but not hairy. and i don't want the only chest-area-no-hair look & ape mouth. Something cool like the comic version of Sabretooth. Huge, agile & super strong.  • Some things we wanna see: - one of the powers we will give him is that his furs can become a super tough shield - he will have a scar burnt mark on his chest   b. med guy - thunderbird descendant tribes. He is a serious & short-tempered character  • Some things we wanna see: This guy will have wings, he will be a bit shorter and slimmer than Bigfoot. He inherited the lightning powers from Thunderbird too.   c. women - lochness descendant tribes. She is a calm, reserved but powerful character.  • Some things we wanna see: I attached a pic in the drive, she has lines in her body where she can bring out water from  • We will keep the gills but not the ears.  • The fins at the wrist & lats will only come out for her when she needs it   3.

0|906|Prepress photo color histogram wizard|Hello,  I am in Nice, France. I have done lots of web design and some print. I printed the following two graphics cards in China and sadly they arrived much too dark, skin tones a bit gray, etc.  I should have known better doing it on an uncalibrated monitor. I bought a new monitor, and calibrated it, but now with so many variables related to profiles and color spaces and print profiles I find it too risky on this project to guess how to proceed.  So, I need someone who can look at the images on their own calibrated display, and understand the histograms so the blacks and highlights and colors look good and not 'blown out'. The main needs are the photos of the faces of the 2 athletes on the font of the two cards (which maybe I have gotten close to correct) and then the smaller 8 photos on the back side of the card. They are the same on each card's backside.  In both cases they were too dark, and one example prints quite yellow, another too red, others blueish. (Arghhhh, it drives me a little crazy but that's why you are here :)  It seems an expert can do this in 2 hours and I would hope it could be done by end of Tuesday. Then I would walk across the street to a professional printer to view a test print on their digital offset printer.  If you wish to proceed I would send a Wetransfer link with the high-res source files not the bad ones attached here.

In order to randomise the NFT generation process, the artist must make 5 different variations of each attribute of the turtle. For example, the turtle must have 5 different smiles, and 5 different types of eyes. The attributes we are looking to include (are open to changes): eyes, hat, shell, mouth, background, stomach. Ultimately, this means that 30 variations of must be made.  We are not looking to take on any artist who is unfamiliar with NFTs.  Upon finding an artist, further information will be provided.||||Entry level|Graphic Design,Adobe Photoshop,Adobe Illustrator|$500.00|4.85|Australia Adelaide|4.85|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01e216fd396cdd1f7a

0|57|Video editing company introduction|To create a video introduction that looks professional and interesting.  I have supplied two long un-edited video files along with separate audio from a microphone that will need to be synced and used. These files have a lot of re-do's but ive left everything in incase you want to clip bits and join them together.  Video length is not set but nothing too long long.  Please create a start and finish slide like in the showreel.  Feel free to be creative with the footage, maybe use elements from the showreel so its not just one long video of me, you could also split into section and have title slides... if that works.  Background audio I have picked 3 from epidemic, if you need the stems or don't like them let me know. Also, if something doesn't come across well or is too awkward let me know I can either re shoot or just take it out.  The aim of the video is just to put a face to the name and give a rough idea of what I do.  A small side note is I think video 2 has more usable stuff as I started getting use to it.  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BjPsHZfv7aPfpwusJyBceKwGpiAew9bJ?usp=sharing|$47.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Video Editing Deliverables,Explainer Video,Corporate Video/Video Editing Services,Audio Editing,Color Grading/Other,Video Editing,Adobe After Effects,Adobe Premiere Pro|$117.50|5.0|United Kingdom Bristol|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01390215bae49e255f

We do this by offering an e-commerce platform which connects owners of sites, such as municipalities of commercial real estate owners, to service providers who install devices.  We are early stage, have a working prototype and some customers.  We want to improve our website to better attract traffice, explain what we do, capture customers interest, and look professional.  There are a few elements of the required work and the vendor can provide some or all of them.  These include: (1)  Creation of an explainer video which describes what we do and captures interest.  We could describe the story and messages, and potentially provide the script too, but we need help ensuring the script makes sense, and with the end to end production process. (2)  Improvement of the website, currently hosted on WIX, to look more professional, to attract and retain the attention of customers and potential recruits, and to increase the likelihood of visitors connecting with us.  We would like advice on how this can be improved, and once scope is agreed, to have it delivered.  It's important that we, despite not being web experts, can add and maintain content ourselves.  We are open minded on whether the site should stay on WIX. (3) Search optimization, to attract more relevant visitors to our site.

And more sci-fi concepts – which are based on plausible science. Such as:    • Alcubierre Drive, Matrioshka Brain.

Some terms can be more than the 8-12 lines, and others less. I don’t want the explanation to be too specific that it goes over peoples heads – no need for technical details. My audience is general public.

0|132|Structural Engineering ~144sf Concrete Shed (simply supported)|This project is for design consideration, but we may build it. Due to our zoning we require no permits, stamps, licensing, or any liability at all on behalf of the engineer. However, it should still generally conform to code, ACI, and relevant standards. No scope creep for this project but future work likely. . It is a ~144 SF covered space made of reinforced concrete (simply supported). It's basically a box open on two sides. It looks like a culvert but it is not. Rather, it is a storage room. No trucks/vehicles, basically nothing will be on top. So the live load will be very small (only minimal based on snow/rain/workers, etc). Roof & walls will be poured at the same time so need to be limited to one concrete delivery (10 cubic yards with 10% waste = 9cy). The interior height must be about ~9 ft, and the depth 7.5 ft. Other dimensions are to be found.  See attachment for all factors.  Questions + expectations:  1) Given some required dimensions, what is the maximum interior span, if the walls & roof combined can be only ~9 cubic yards of concrete? * Note, footing & floor slab are NOT part of 9 cubic yard limit. They will be poured separate. * Please provide number and show work.  2) What is rebar layout, spacing & location? * Note: Ideally, use only #5 rebar (for all flex & temp/shrinkage) * Provide rebar sizing & layout as drawing & documentation.  3) Is shear bracing required? *  Run shear calc and provide answer with support, and relevant documentation.  4) Other comments or concerns? * Optional, but encouraged if further investigation on any aspect should be pursued||||Entry level|Structural Engineering,Civil Engineering,Reinforced Concrete Structures,Structural Analysis|$350.00|5.0|United States Phoenix|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~018bb2a87aa93223aa
0|132|Concrete Column Steel Jacket Connection Design|The subject is simple and quick to the point - existing situation is a reinforced cylindrical concrete column with 50cm diameter (and another at 70cm). Steel I Beams (IPE 300 & IPE360) are meant to be laterally supported on the subject column - however regular base plate design has been rejected by client due to increased anchor bolts (8 is too much)  The suggested connection is basically a steel jacket with 14mm thickness is supposed to be bolted into the column through 4 or 8 bolts (M20 preferred) however the anchoring must be done from 4 directions (in order to minimize centralized forces acting on column.  The plate is to surround said column with a tight fit (no gap between plate and column to be considered) and then an IPE 300 (and in another case an IPE360) is to be welded to the circular jacket. as shown in attached cad file (CAD file of screenshot displayed)  All details required and specifications are available and will be provided as needed by the designer - its a very straightforward job and all the is needed is a structural connection safety report with reasonable bolt locations and analysis.  Please note, that I would like to know the methodology by which the designer is going to make said connection.

0|405|Fix our PostgreSQL SSL Certificate Issues|We will pay a minimum of 4 hours of your published rate for this task.  We are running PostgreSQL on Ubuntu Linx on an on-premises server, serving as our corporate data warehouse.  We use both FiveTran and Stitch Data to extract data from cloud applications and load into our PostgreSQL data warehouse.    A few days ago, we started getting SSL certificate errors on both FiveTran and Stitch when they try to connect to the PostgreSQL database.  Extractions and loads were working fine before a few days ago.  These are the error messages we get: “Unable to validate certificate:  Connection Reset” (FiveTran) and “Critical SSL Syscall error:  Connection reset by peer” (Stitch Data)  We need someone to look at our current SSL certificate configuration for our PostgreSQL database and to help us troubleshoot and repair what is causing this error.  To provide you with access, we would need to coordinate a call with you, have one of our IT administrators access the server the database runs on, and then let you either guide us or share their screen with you on the remote session to work through the configuration.    This is an urgent need as our data warehouse has not refreshed in several days.  Please only reply if you have direct experience with PostgreSQL SSL configuration.  |$95.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|/Databases,PostgreSQL/Other,SSL,Linux|$411.67||United States Windsor|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01c7e9152bd21efea6

0|136|Non-Circumvent Clause Added to NDA|I think we have a solid mutual NDA.  I would just like to add two things to it:  1. To make it clear that it applies to both the current legal entity and any subsidiary or partner companies.  We are creating a new entity shortly that the parent company will have an equity stake in.  But it's not clear at the moment whether they will be a majority owner, and this agreement needs to protect that new company too regardless of the equity stake we end up having in it.  2. We need an additional clause that prohibits the company we are taking to from partnering with any bank or financial institution we introduce them to in any way that is competitive or cannibalizing.  Essentially we don't want them to circumvent us to create or enable competition using a strategic partner we introduced them to, unless we approve.    My hope is we can accomplish both of these with just a handful of sentences in total.  I'm hoping to get this done as soon as possible - tonight or tomorrow.

We've taken a first approach to creating a draft of this which we had a paralegal take our T&C's from our writer and editor subcontracts and amend them to the new T&C's document.  A few particular questions and goals:  1.) Is mass termination of the contracts feasible via email or does it have to be done individually?  2.) Is it enough to just have writers know that upon signing into the WordAgents platform after the contract is terminated, that they are to be bound by our new writer/editor T&C's?  Goals  1.) Eliminate Contractor Agreements Between Word Agents and Our Editors (Too cumbersome for any meaningful change-management. We have various contracts from various points in time that exist and it's not feasible for us financially or operationally to manage all these agreements individually.)  2.) Further reduce any legal liability that may arise from any claims that may be brought against WordAgents from writers/editors that are using our platform.  3.) Determine if we need to integrate some of the SPP Terms & Conditions into ours - since they are the platform that supports WordAgents.  4.)Mass terminate all contracts with our contractors once our new T&C's are approved and up on the website for writers and editors to review. (We want to send out an email just letting them know about this policy change within the business and essentially that by accessing/logging into any/all WordAgents platforms, that they agree to abide by the terms set forth in these new T&C's.  5.) Eliminate any ambiguity between contractor vs employee.

0|1473|Licensed Attorneys Needed as Panel Experts in Wage and Hour Employment Law Webinar|We are in need of three licensed attorneys with experience in labor law to be guest speakers and panel experts for a customer webinar based featuring a live question and answer session addressing recent developments in wage and hour labor laws. Our audience is small to medium-sized employers from every U.S. state (roughly 10% from California), and the roughly 60-minute webinar session includes a brief summary of recent legislative action and a 45-minute Questions and Answers period.  The introductory summary of recent developments will explore wage and hour laws categorized into three sections; wages, legislation/enforcement, and paid time off. Each expert will cover a section, submitting content for 1-2 slides and subsequently presiding over that topic’s questions during the extended Q&A session. Crossover input and opinions on topics covered by your panel expert counterparts is welcomed and encouraged overall. Although we plan to focus on these specific labor law topics (as they are the most prevalent), we expect there to be questions that will not fall into these categories. Any such questions can be answered by a volunteer panel expert or assigned impromptu.  The content submission for the 1-2 topic slides should be approximately 500 words and can include a list of key legislative developments and/or a general explanation of the topic’s impact on wage and hour laws at large. Additionally, the attorney will need to provide three bulleted tips to be used at the conclusion of the presentation.  The hired attorneys will be assigned one of the following sections to cover:  Wages • Minimum Wage & Overtime • Tipped employees • Industry-specific wage and hour requirements • City/county wage and hour • Subminimum wage • Legislation, enforcement & initiatives • Recent DOL guidance • Increased enforcement and investigator staff • Electronic records – Android and IOS timesheets • Wage and Hour Division H2B Employee Enforcement Initiative • Inflation – Consumer Price Index  Paid Time Off and Medical Leave • State and Federal PTO Laws • Existing and Expiring Covid-19 Leave • FMLA for diagnosed mental health issues • Disability Leave and other allowances   NOTE:  This list of webinar topics may evolve based on the subject matter expert’s recommendations. Any other pertinent topics addressing recent wage and hour labor law developments should be added at your discretion.  The webinars are run by us in the office and you will join us via Go-to-Webinar. We introduce you, your background, and then have an outline prepared that you would use (we run the presentation on our end). Once the introductory presentations are completed, we open it up to a Q and A session with our customers (they write in the questions, we read them to you, and you answer). Each speaker will present for approximately 5 minutes, and actively participate in the live Q&A session for the duration of the webinar, focusing on questions from their assigned wage and hour category.  Overall, if you agree to participate, it would require you to attend two rehearsals and then serve as guest speaker on the final webinar. Each of these steps takes approximately one hour. There will be minimal preparation time needed for the webinar outside of familiarizing yourself with your topic’s employer implications.  You would not need to physically be in our presence at any time. All of this is done over the phone and Internet via Go-to-Webinar.  Here is a rough schedule so you can see when about things would happen (all dates are subject to change):  Ask the Attorneys: Evolving Wage and Hour Labor Laws  Summary Content Due (Attorneys) – Friday, September 30 Outline Written (by us internally)  – Thursday, October 6 Presentation (Created by us internally from legal brief)  – Thursday, October 6 Practice 1 (all) – Thursday, October 13  (11:00 - 12:00 noon Pacific Time) Practice 2 (all) - Tuesday, October 18 (11:00 - 12:00 noon Pacific Time) Live Webinar (all) – Thursday, October 20 (11:00 -12:00 noon Pacific Time)  Practices, as well as the live webinar are held on West Coast time (PST or PDT).

0|1463|Apartment lease potential dispute review|We lease an apartment from Camden Foothills in Scottsdale AZ. They require 60 day notice at the end of lease term to confirm that we will be terminating our lease, or it will automatically go month-to-month. Our lease ends Nov 1, 2020. On August 30 I sent Camden written notice that we will not renew the current lease, but intend to go month-to-month for one month ( based on advice from a realtor in Dallas TX, where we would search for a home to buy, despite delays due to the COVID-19 crisis). We did not sign anything with Camden, and terminating a month-to-month requires only 30 days notice. Surprisingly, we found a new home to buy in Dallas last week, and can close in October, eliminating the need for the month-to-month extension in November, here in AZ. To comply with the required notice to terminate a month-to-month, and in the spirit of open and honest communication, yesterday I sent a new notice via email  to Camden indicating we won't need the month-to-month after all, and will vacate when our current lease expires, on November 30. I then received a cryptic response, implying they require a 60-day notice (?) and appear to be positioning to bill us another $2.8K for the single month-to-month that we don't need after all. I am suspicious of their intent. before further interaction, I need an attorney to review our lease, and my email communication. Obviously, we would like to avoid paying for an additional month's lease at an exorbitant rate that we don't need.  It appears that despite my pro-active communication, Camden is trying to extract another month's rent, despite my notice that our plans have changed.|$85.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/Agreements,Property & Equipment Lease|$113.33|5.0|United States Scottsdale|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0120c8c306236e8e06

0|352|Paralegal needed to annotate components of legal sentences|Who we are: We are a group of Natural Language Processing researchers looking for 2 domain experts in legal writing/ paralegal services/ legal research to help annotate the legal sentences we have. We need your help to correct the mistakes our machine might make in annotating the sentences.  Who you are: We are looking for a paralegal highly proficient in reading, comprehending and writing legal documents. The task will include an initial qualification test to test domain knowledge and annotation accuracy.  What's the job: The task will require you to annotate parts of individual sentences in the legal domain, using a  web-based application. The task is composed of:  1. Identifying an action and nuance of meaning of the action in a sentence:    a) She caught the ball        i) 'Catch' is the action        ii) The 'catch' in the above sentence has a different meaning from the 'catch' in 'He caught some sleep' 2.

You will then need to say if the identified causer/receiver of the action produced by the machine is correct and to provide the necessary correction otherwise.  Unlike the simplified examples above, the actual task will be on longer and complex/compound legal sentences.  How long is this going to take and when we need it: We anticipate the task to take about 20-30 hrs for each domain expert.

And since then, I have had a nightmare of a time trying to ensure our business is doing the right thing in 2 countries.  In the beginning we were a 2 member LLC (owned by my husband and I) and we used the treaty to filter our tax to Australia. HOWEVER, the accountant put on our 1040NR that we have no ECIT or PE. Which another accountant is saying is wrong and we do have ECIT & PE.  We were recommended to reduce our tax in Australia by changing the LLC to be owned by an Australian company (single member).I seeked advice from over half a dozen accountants who said this was fine. Then 1 said no, this causes the business to then be taxed at the Ccorp rate of 21% or Branch level of 30%. Of which we would not get a tax treaty exempt for and have to pay US tax. And if we change to a single member LLC, we also need a new EIN?  Our business being in supplements,  we have to have US insurance to sell in the US. So we have a PO BOX address, we use a 3pl to house the inventory,  we also get a few items made in the US using a 3rd party manufacturer.  We send them raw materials and they make it for us. They are not in the state we are incorporated in. The main office of operations is in Australia.We have no one physically in the US working for us. Mostly our business is a Amazon online sales business.   We also have a US bank- though we really do not need to. Its just easier to receive funds.  I need CORRECT advice on what to do. How should we be getting taxed, should we be paying tax in the US and getting a treaty OR have the tax paid in Australia? Which documents do we lodge? Do we have ECIT and PE? Do I need to change my EIN if I become a single member?  We wanted to reduce our tax, as the business is growing 50-100% per year and we soon will trigger high Australian tax brackets.  |$195.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month||/American Bar Association State Licensing,New Hampshire Bar Association/Other,International Taxation,Tax Law|$130.00||United States Rochester|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01747f87e613d368b1
0|1258|Tax Opinion Letter (Multiple Industries)|I'm in search of an attorney, paralegal, CPA, or EA who can assist with the drafting of tax opinion letters for our CPA firm.  Our sole focus is Employee Retention Tax Credits. That is literally all that we do.  Without getting too much into the weeds in this job description, we have clients in certain industries that most certainly for these credits because a government mandate caused a full or partial suspension of their operations.  The easiest examples of this are restaurants. Every restaurant in the country had indoor dining restrictions during the pandemic. And until they were opened back up with 100% indoor dining capacity, they qualified.  However, there are more nuanced cases where more interpretation is required.  Our CPA's understand these credits well enough to arrive at an opinion of substantial authority. However, we lack the experience of writing tax opinion letters.  This is a unique case given that these credits are relatively new and there is currently no case law, no precedent, no audits have been undertaken on any of this. All we have is the legislation and tax code, FAQ's, and three Notices that provide additional guidance and more FAQ's.  For the astute researcher, you may find drafts or committee minutes that further support the intention of the legislators when they passed this program as part of the CARES Act, and the three subsequent bills that solidify the current program.  If you know nothing about Employee Retention Credits but you are experienced with drafting tax opinion letters, then this could be a great fit for you still.  You will not be signing your name to these letters. You will be operating under the supervision of our chief CPA and he will ultimately take ownership of this opinion.  Again, we can guide/coach you through the research that will form the basis of your opinion, but you will still need to sift through the material and structure the memo in such a way as to be compliant with the latest Circular 230 rules.  My thought is that we will likely have a separate memo for each of a few industries, and those memos could vary by state - depending on whether the government mandates are more federal or state authority.  The facts of the case could also be different for each client whereby the client is asked a series of questions about their operations which further supports our eventual opinion as to their qualifying dates.  I look forward to discussing the scope of this project with a professional and this could be the start of a beautiful partnership over the next couple of years.|$225.00||||Tax Law,CPA,Legal,US Taxation|$825.00||United States Austin|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01eaa54b5f7b91b46b
0|1258|Single member LLC with owner outside US - consulting on entity election and tax strategy|"I am the sole member of a Wyoming LLC, and am seeking advice how to best manage tax for the LLC and myself, in both the US and Japan. I’m a US citizen living continuously in Japan for about 6 years. I am especially concerned about the mismatch in tax treatment between the US vs Japan as Japan does not have disregarded entities.  Desired output for this project: 1) 30 minute phone consultation 2) Some email follow-up to clarify and record the main points of our discussion.  My current situation: 1) The LLC currently has disregarded entity status with the IRS. 2) The LLC holds shares in various startups which will hopefully realize some capital gains, so the revenue may be volatile year-to-year. I am expecting around $40K revenue this year in the LLC for example, but probably close to zero revenue in 2024 for example. 3) As Japan does not have disregarded entities, it seems there may be a mismatch between LLC taxation in the US and a potential scenario for double taxation without relief. While any Japan-specific experience you may have is appreciated, general experience on the issue of ""mismatched"" status in the US and overseas is what I am after. 4) I have been considering C Corp election as a preventive measure for item #3 above and would appreciate perspective on how effective that would be, pros and cons of a single owner C Corp, with myself as a part-time employee living outside the US, any pitfalls to be aware of, etc.  Or, alternate strategies to avoid this issue."|$195.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|International Taxation,US Taxation,Limited Liability Company,C-Corporation|$227.50||United States Garden City|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01fc4d528a283e252e

0|439|Facebook & Google Ads Apprentice (For Female market e-commerce brands)|Hey there! We’re a small boutique marketing agency looking to hire and train a Paid Ads apprentice. We’ll be teaching you the ins-and-outs of Facebook and Google Ads, and you’ll learn on the job while helping us with some of our client work.  We’re very good at what we do: We’ve taken over accounts where other agencies gave up and 3x’d profit. Right now we need an extra pair of hands to take some of the regular day-to-day tasks off our plate, and over time we want to train that person to do more and more. If you’re up for it, we’d love to turn you into a world-class marketer who ends up training the next apprentice we hire.  Our two biggest clients are a skincare brand co-founded by two women, and a wedding apparel brand that’s been in business for over 75 years. We can train you in all the technical skills, but at minimum we need someone who understands how products are marketed to women. It will be much harder for us to train someone who only ever gets ads for Axe Body Spray.  IMPORTANT: we need someone who can commit 3-4 hours every weekday to this role (at least for the first month or so). We’ll teach you everything you need to know, but you’ll need to be organized, have great communication, and be resourceful.  The nature of this work requires quick turnaround time – if an account is bleeding money, we can’t wait 24-48 hours to adjust the parameters. And because it takes time to let ads run, the difference in speed between doing something today vs tomorrow really adds up over the course of a month.  We need someone who:  [+] Is very comfortable with the English language, since part of the job involves copywriting (but being in a Western country is not a requirement as long as you’re fluent) [+] Has an eye for design and aesthetics (you’ll need to do semi-subjective visual work like tweaking colors, changing font sizes, etc.) [+] Isn’t scared of numbers (you don’t need a PhD in math, but you need to be comfortable digging through data and looking at spreadsheets) [+] Is a great communicator (be proactive about messaging when something is wrong, clearly articulate what issues you’re having, take notes when we’re giving you instructions, take feedback well, etc.) [+] Can work at least 3-4 hours every weekday (you’ll have more flexibility to set your own schedule as time goes on, but we need certain things done the same day during the training period. We’ll do our best to match your timezone if needed, but we need your effort too.) [+] Willing to put in the work (for their own growth – we’ll give you some reading material to go through if you need to catch up in certain areas) [+] Is familiar with female-targeted marketing (as mentioned earlier) [+] Is familiar with the basics of Paid Ads (if you’ve never run a Facebook or Google Ad before, it will probably take too long to train you. But you also don’t need to already be an expert. If you have very little experience but still want this job, we can just give you some extra reading material you’ll need to go through on your own time to compensate)  Payment will be on an hourly basis for now, but we’ll turn it into a retainer as you take on more responsibilities.  If your proposal looks good, we’ll give you a short (paid) test project to see where your skills are at.  -Carlos|$10.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|3 to 6 months|Intermediate|Facebook ads|$10.00|5.0|United States Queens County|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~016e452cc3f28cd642

0|105|Looking for PR specialist to help launch of consumer tech brand|hello! We are JungleDisk, a mostly B2B cloud backup and recovery company based in San Antonio, TX. We have recently acquired a consumer focused cloud storage brand that we will be pivoting to the parenting space. We are looking for a PR specialist to help our story.  What is our story? ElephantDrive is 16 years old and has helped save millions of memories. Earlier this year we realized that working with families, often in multiple generations, to help them backup their photos, videos, documents and files is what we love to do most, so we started the process of completely redesigning ElephantDrive to tell this story.  The cloud storage space is busy - there's google, icloud, dropbox, box.com, backblaze and plenty of others. however, we feel most of these are the equivelent of storage facilities, lots of space to throw lots of crap in, but no real protection or customer service.  We are the safety deposit box, we want to protect what's most valuable. We strive to make sure that what's backed up is always able to be recovered..either tomorrow, or in 10 years.  The idea of this came from my childhood - having very few photos, and realizing that it's even harder to preserve digital files then it is physical.  We are aiming to get press for this with parenting focused publications as well as influencers/social media/etc.  Can tell a lot more of the story to the right person.|$150.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|Film Direction,Video Production,Public Relations,Social Media Marketing,WordPress,Adobe After Effects,Adobe Photoshop,Adobe Premiere Pro,Social Media Content,Website,Social Media Advertising,Digital Marketing,Tech & IT|$9,050.00|5.0|United States San Antonio|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0166ebcd38fc2bc045

This job involves calling businesses by telephone, reading a very short script to get permission to place a free candy box in their location. It is an easy job finding locations for these charity candy boxes.  Calling on restaurants, beauty salons, auto repair and more to get permission. You then verify information, and getting a ""yes"".  Next, you cut & paste their info from the lead list to a spreadsheet.  No selling involved; just get permission/""YES"" from prospects. If you have experience doing something similar, that is a big plus.  The charities are National Children's Cancer Association, Missing Children Association and more.  Pay is $3.00 per appointment. The appointments are easy because you don't need to set up a time, just let them know a ""driver"" will drop off a vending display during their business hours. 5+ appointments per hour is common. You should be easily making $10.00 to $15.00+ per hour.  A typical request would be for you to get on the phone and secure 20 locations/appointments within a given area. For a job like that we would pay $60.00 upon completion.  We will start on a trial basis. If this works out, we can hire permanent and give more jobs.  Unpredictable work load. Sometimes we will need you to work 5 hours per week, sometimes 20. Depends on how many jobs we get on a weekly basis.  This is a simple, no pressure job.

We expect that you should complete the location lists in a timely manner in order to work permanent position.  We are looking for serious, reliable individuals that are interested in long term part time work. You must enjoy being on the phone. Must have a friendly, pleasant speaking, easy to understand voice.

What is needed: A mix of editing existing translations and creating new translations.  NOTE: Please submit fixed budget proposals, thank you  We are an organisation that helps business people with their thinking. We do this by creating profiles for people based on how they think.  We calculate these profiles by using a 24-question online questionnaire. Users must complete these 24 questions in order for us to show them their thinking profile.  As well as the 24 questions, the questionnaire also contains some introductory pages with instructions, and a thank-you page that appears after the user completes the questionnaire.  We need translations of the whole questionnaire process - from English - into French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Danish and Simplified Chinese.  We already have existing translations for a lot of this, but these need to be updated due to some updates we have made in English.  So that you can better understand the context of what you are translating, we ask that you participate in the whole questionnaire process yourself. This will take about 20 minutes of your time.  We also have some small sections in our existing translations that need to be removed or edited. You will need to help us with this so that the translation still makes sense to native readers after these removals have been done. They are small but important to check.  Please bear in mind the following when submitting a proposal for this job:  1. You will need to spend 20 minutes doing our questionnaire yourself (in English) to understand the context of what you will be translating. This is very important.  2. Approximate number of new words to be translated are: For Danish and Chinese: 300 words approx. For French, Spanish, Dutch and German: 336 words approx.  3. Overall structure of the job looks like this:  Intro Page: Translations already exist, but approx. 10 words need to be added at various points (with the whole page still making sense after the additions)  Intro Page 2: Translations already exist, but approx. 6 words need to be added at various points (with the whole page still making sense after the additions)  Intro Page 3: Approx 110 words of new translation  Questions 1-24: Approx 36 words due to changes in some of the questions (not required in Danish and Chinese). Wording here is very important, so you will need to have a nuanced understanding of the meaning here.  Thank-you page: Approx 180 words of new translation  We look forward to hearing from you.

The objective is to identify posts with REAL Negative meanings and summarize them in English -- no need to translate them in full, we are looking to capture the gist of the post.

Mandatory Requirements: 1) Daily availability + commitment to attendance (will show up on time for work every time) 2) Fast, stable internet 3) Willingness to handle content that can be sensitive, offensive or displeasing 4) Excelllent Urdu reading+listening skills and superb English writing skills 5) Skype (preferred) or google chat to make it easier to communicate in real-time during actual operations. 6) Never ever use Google translate or any machine translation tool to handle any part of your work with us for any reason, no exceptions. The contract calls for 100% human translation, so we reserve the right to not pay any work that involved the use of such tools. Violation of this clause will also compel us to permanently remove you from our list of translators.  To be a best fit for this project you need to:  Be 100% awake+alert+productive at those timeslots Be a Quick learner and willing to continuously improve Never give up despite difficulties and unexpected challenges Have attention to detail and pride in your work Be a responsible adult -- do not abandon the project mid-way, or simply disappear without advance notice.

I have a really short script written in basic American English that I need translated into ASL.  This project will require you to record and submit a video of you signing what the script says. I’d prefer it if you signed slow enough for me to be able to see your movements but not slow enough to where it’s at a snail’s pace. Also, make sure that you have captions turned on, to allow me to see what is being signed.  I have a basic understanding of ASL but not enough for me to comfortably translate the script myself. I can’t really make mistakes because this is supposed to be a learning channel, so I’d rather just let a fluent speaker take the reigns.  I will provide the very short script and a sample clip of my animations for you to have everything you need for this gig. Hopefully, the sample clip will allow you an idea of what the channel will be about.  I’m an Audiology major who grew up with a half-deaf dad.

0|659|ongoing Unity, Blender & VR/AR consulting|I am working on a variety of XR projects and am looking to consult with an expert on an ongoing basis for small task requests. Ideally, I'd like to pay on an hourly basis. Please take a look at the Skills list in this posting and let me know which of these you are familiar with.  My background is in 2D video and 360 video production. Recently, I've been experimenting with more interactivity in education, training and art VR projects that have required using Unity, 3DVista and Blender. I am interested in continuing this exploration into interactivity and look forward to utilizing Vuforia and 8th Wall for some AR projects.  One of my goals is to expand my own education. So, I will often request that the execution of a basic task include a screen capture recording demonstrating how to perform the task. For more complex tasks, this will not be necessary.  Some of the tasks may only take a 15 minutes to complete. For instance, if I  forget how to export a model from Blender properly and want a reminder of how to do that. Other tasks may take a few hours. Perhaps, researching and prototyping the best platform to use for a particular AR activation. Are you comfortable tracking time with a tool like Toggl and then I'll pay the accumulated time for tasks on a monthly basis? I'm open to other budget & billing suggestions. Let me know what you think will work best.  Hopefully, as I deepen my understand of what is possible with these tools, how long certain kinds of tasks take to complete and the best ways for us to collaborate, I will be able to incorporate more interactive XR offerings to clients and we can continue to work together as the resulting projects come through the pipeline.||Less than 30 hrs/week|3 to 6 months||/AR/VR Tools,Unity,Vuforia,ARKit/Mobile Programming Languages,JavaScript,C#/Other,3D Modeling,Blender,Augmented Reality,Virtual Reality,Unity||5.0|United States Brooklyn|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0186cc22a37a4d36cb

Upon waking, it returns to kiosk app. • Estimate in hours to develop a simple Samsung Gear VR 'container/viewer app' which plays 1 of 2 * 360 videos ○ Videos will be loaded on device (no internet connectivity required per se) ○ App needs to run in kiosk + standby option as above ○ App needs to be able to be installed/downloaded onto multiple Samsung S7's (whether from a 'store' or manually loaded etc)  After our call I will pay and rate you well. I am also hoping to build long term networks/connections from this.  To apply for this discussion, please provide video/links/proof that you have developed Samsung VR Gear apps before.

0|1188|Building AirTable Workflows to Manage Marketing Services for Clients|We are looking for an experienced AirTable expert who can help us set up bases and workflows to manage our authors' marketing services. We currently have four marketing packages as well as individual a la carte services. We are moving towards a team approach to service delivery and are transitioning to AirTable from GoogleSheets to better be able to manage tasks, deadlines, and projects with multiple people involved in service delivery.   - To create trackers that will allow us to deliver services with a team approach. This means within services, we will need to assign specific tasks with deadlines to specific people - We want individuals to be able to view the projects they are collaborators on, as well as individual tasks - We want to be able to view the workload of each individual. Ideally, by the amount of unearned revenue on each individual’s plate as well as tasks. Ideas for other productivity metrics are welcome - We want to be able to view the amount of earned revenue completed weekly and monthly for the team, as well as by each individual. This means each task will likely need a value assigned to it - We would like to view the above information in chart form such as a pie chart with percentages by collaborator - We would like to have an expenses base to track expenses for the team. I think tracking the team’s monthly expenses would be sufficient. We don’t necessarily need to track individual expenses here - We would like to have a base to manage our author website renewals and reminders  Currently, we are using GoogleSheets which works with the individual approach of one team member managing a client's full scope of marketing services. However, we have introduced new marketing packages that will be executed by a team of people, and need a better way to manage services and packages.  Our team has set up an initial base to manage workflows, but we got stuck on a few items such as not being able to track individual ouput in the form of earned revenue completed. We are looking for someone to set up our bases and workflows in a way that meets our needs.|$20.00||1 to 3 months||/Business Size,Business with 10-99 Employees/Other,Airtable,Automated Workflow,Business Process Automation,Business Process Management Software|$2,543.35|5.0|Canada Victoria|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~015cec10a76bd01892

0|1691|Timelocked eth testnet tokens|This is a proof of concept around working with timelocked tokens. Doing it largely for education about the limits and possibilities of timelocking tokens.  TLDR: Owner creates a new token and grants it to 10 eth addresses but the tokens for each address are timelocked. Owner can release timelock or change the block height of timelock (increase/decrease) and can also change the number of tokens within each eth address timelock.  ETH TESTNET PROJECT  Requirements for test project: owner deploys contract and initial tokens to self and 10 eth addresses distribute tokens to 10 addresses, separate timelock time is set on each address (they will all be different) owner can add additional coins to those timelocked addresses individually owner can burn portion or all of the coins in those timelocks owner can change timelock time to increase or decrease it for each eth address that is timelocked         owner can unlock timelocked coins so they are released to eth address owner (might need to be claimable or could be sent)  I am not sure of the best methods for achieving the flexibility above. I've done some solidity and reading on different timelock methods and pros/cons but I'll leave it up to the developer to choose a method based on my above criteria. Would appreciate an explanation of why they did it that way and avoided other ways of organizing the project in the end.||||Intermediate|/Emerging Tech Subjects,Blockchain,Cryptocurrency/Blockchain & NFT Deliverables,Smart Contract/Cryptocurrencies,Ethereum/Other,Blockchain Development,binance smart chain,Ethereum|$50.00|5.0|United States San Francisco|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013bcede1b9e3bc77a

I need help developing a commercial site that focuses on three products: (1) headshots; (2) fashion model portfolios; (3) commercial fashion photography.  I have a site that I have begun building out using Thrive Themes.  It is hosted on DreamPress. I find that Thrive is visually uninteresting and not good for a photographer. I have started on the Landing Page, Headshot and Fashion Model pages. I’m not satisfied with any of the work I’ve done, so far and I am very frustrated with the inability of Thrive to produce a result that looks good on all three types of devices. I would not be opposed to cancelling the Thrive account and using an entirely different approach. I would love to have your thoughts on this.  The site will need the following: 1. Landing page that has the following: a. A strong presentation of a hero image or video. Because this is a photographer’s site. the landing page must be visually interesting. I will supply the image or images. b. In must introduce my three main products and funnel the client to the correct service description page c. Should have one or more testimonial blocks d. Have a footer with a mail list signup linked to an existing MailChimp account  2. The service pages listed below, each with an image gallery, carousel, or slider, a single testimonial block, mail list signup, and a call-to-action button that links to a Squarespace Scheduling page. The scheduling page can be integrated with the site. a. Headshots b. Fashion Model Portfolios c. Commercial Fashion Photography  3. Free-standing gallery pages for headshots, fashion model portfolios, and commercial fashion photography.  Alternatively, a single gallery with all three types of images might work, if the viewer could select the category of images he wanted. You can see one such gallery here. on an old, decommissioned web page of mine.  The gallery page or pages should also include call-to-action buttons linking to the appropriate scheduling page.  4. An “About” page with a text and photo block. I will draft the About language. 5. Contact page with photo and text blocks 6. Terms and conditions page. I will draft T&C. A link to the T&C should appear on the scheduling page. A client should agree to T&C when he or she books an appointment. 7. Blog  When it’s done, I will need to be able to add or remove photos from all the galleries and pages and to revise text easily without breaking the site.    If you are interested in this project, could you provide me with your estimated cost to complete it? Could you also give me an idea of how long it will take? Thanks for your time.

0|591|Unbounce landing page builder|My venture capital business is beginning to release content that we'd like to keep behind lead gen forms and as part of this activity we need to set up landing pages. A few more details - a) The content will include videos and downloadable PDFs. b) The landing pages need to look great and be in line with the existing brand guidelines (see attached) and to match the style of our existing website, lionbird.com and to exist in a subdomain of the website (for example, as resources.lionbird.com) c) our current website is hosted in wordpress and our email list is in Mailchimp. That said, I would like to build the landing pages using Unbounce and have it integrated with those two as well as analytics (am open to exploring other landing page solutions and to learning about which analytics may be best to implement). d) I am not an expert in landing pages and will require some level of guidance on the ideal structure and flow for these pages so that they adhere to best practices for landing page conversion e) everything needs to be easily self maintained and extended easily without coding experience.  We already have some of the content that will live behind the conversion forms written and are ready to start with this asap.|$120.00|Less than 30 hrs/week|1 to 3 months||WordPress,Unbounce,Adobe Illustrator,Adobe Photoshop,Adobe InDesign,Project Management|$1,440.00|5.0|Israel Tel Aviv|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0122b0b40afb4b5354

We are looking for a skilled Wordpress expert to use this theme and templates to build the menus and pages, design the layout of the website within the theme, and apply the designed theme to our Wordpress site.  We have a wireframe sketch design for the website, a brand guide, logos, blog content, and website copy ready to go, and will provide those for you to use. The site will need pages, which will be: Home, About, Blog, Learn, Shop, Podcast, Contact. The home page will be a static page and home base for the website with a brief explanation of our brand, who we are, and our mission statement. The About page will be our backstory, and why our mission statement is important. The blog will be a blog page that I will update with new posts weekly. I’ll need to be shown how to make sure that new posts go to this page, not the home page. We also want to make sure that social icons are on the blog page.The Learn page will be an online learning portal where visitors can purchase pre-recorded ecourses. (the Learn page needs to be set up, but not live yet… we don’t have the content for it. These courses will have a pay wall and will be videos that people pay to gain access to.) The Podcast page will have embedded rss feed code from our Anchor page. The Shop will have merch for sale (also needs to be set up, but not public yet). The Contact page will just be a form where people can submit questions etc.  Important Details: We are looking for someone who can use the theme that we've purchased, and customize it to these requirements, then teach us how to make blog posts publish to the correct place, how to add things to the merch shop, and how to upload elearning video courses, and how to publish the Learn and Shop pages later.

Both of these sheets also provide customer information - name, date of order, type of order (pick-up, delivery or waiter service), phone number, email and house address if applicable.  We compile all the catering checklist sheets for the week in another file.  The first worksheet is a summary by client of the orders for the week (""Weekly Summary Sheet"").  The individual client checklist orders follow this sheet.  The last worksheet summarizes all the menu items ordered for the week - i.e., details how many racks of ribs, trays of mac and cheese, etc.  This sheet is manually inputted and would especially want to automate it based on the original client checklist sheets.

0|228|Steamy Billionaire Romance series needed, 6 installments of ~15K word apiece|I am looking for romance ghostwriters to write a steamy billionaire romance series.  I’m willing to pay $0.02 US per word – so $300 for a 15,000 word installment.  If I hire you, I will send you a link to a book for you to ‘model.’ NO PLAGIARISM. I don’t want you to read the book.  You will look at the reviews for the book… Take major plot points from those reviews… Fix what people hate about them (annoying heroine, for instance)… And play up what people love about them (strong alpha male hero, for instance). And then you’ll write a book that’s totally your own, based on the structure and elements you get from the reviews.  What I want: - Six installments of a series, each one around 15,000 words. - 12K to 20K per installment is acceptable if the story for that installment warrants it. I want an entertaining story in each installment, NOT robotic writing that ends at 14,999 words. - Installments 1-5 must end on a cliffhanger that leads directly into the next installment. The sixth and final installment will wrap up with an HEA ending. - NO PADDING. I want a lean, interesting, fun, fast read. Don’t write a bunch of fluff just to make an extra $50 on word count. If we work well together, I will be giving you as much work as you want, so don’t pad the word count.  If the entire series only ends up at 70K, that’s fine, I’ll have you start on another series right away.  Deliverables (if I hire you): - An outline of the six installments, with three or four plot points per installment, plus the cliffhanger for each installment. I will also want a list of the things people loved about the book you’re modeling, what they hated, and a brief description of how you plan to fix/avoid the problems. Also include what you plan for each deleted scene (see below for more info) for each installment. You should be able to include all that in 1 to 2 pages at the most. This part will require research on the book you’ll be modeling, so I’ll pay a $100 flat fee for your time and the outline. We’ll correspond via email until I feel the cliffhangers and plot points are good to go. - Then I will want to see the first 5000 words of the first installment. This part is purely to judge if your writing style is what I’m looking for. If I think the first 5000 words are good, you’ll continue and finish the first installment. If the first 5K words are not a good fit for what I want as far as writing style, then I’ll pay you for the 5K and we’ll part ways. - I’ll want the installments delivered as you finish them. - As mentioned above, I also want ‘deleted scenes’ that I can offer to readers as bonuses. These will typically be from the hero’s perspective, if the book is written entirely from the heroine’s perspective. The deleted scenes will be no more than 2-5K apiece, typically one deleted scene per installment. This should be fairly easy – you’ll just be rewriting a scene from the hero’s perspective. - At the end of the series, I also want you to supply a blurb – a 200-400 word description of the book. Make it exciting and interesting, not a recitation of plot points. You can model it on the blurb for your target book, the one you’ll be using as a template for your series, or on another billionaire romance.  I will have the installments edited by someone else, but I expect your writing to be reasonably free of typos and grammatical errors. I expect you to do a proofread of all your work before you submit it to me, although I realize that errors do slip through.  If you have writing samples I can read, please send those. Let me know if you’ve written billionaire romance before, and any other subgenres of romance you’ve written.  I would prefer an installment and deleted scene (roughly 18K words) per week, and even faster if possible – but first and foremost I want GOOD writing. If it takes you two weeks to deliver that, fine. I would rather have good work that takes longer, rather than mediocre work that’s delivered faster.  When you apply, let me know how fast you estimate you can complete each installment. Be honest. If I love your writing samples, I’ll make exceptions on deadlines.  If we enjoy working with each other, I promise that you’ll have lots more work, as long as the quality stays consistent.  I put a premium on people who remain in contact with me and will respond within 24 hours of getting an email. The faster the response time, the better.  Be advised that if I hire you, I will want you to sign a legal agreement through Docusign outside of any legal agreements provided by Upwork. It will be very standard and cover the points I’ve listed above.  ***IMPORTANT: when you reply to this posting, put the phrase “better to have loved and lost” in your reply so I know that you read my job description all the way through to the end. You can just type the phrase in as the first line of your reply.||||Intermediate|Creative Writing,Novel,Romance,Ghostwriting,English,Writing,Fiction,Fiction Writing||5.0|United States North Hollywood|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01943dd6335822030e

Each book around 40,000 words about one character and her journey. We offer $0.05 per word, so a book with 40,000 words would generate $2,000 in income.  The series is a mix of Fantasy and History with a dose of action/drama. The writer would be given the entire plot of each story bit by bit, so there is not much to worry about “not finding the right inspiration for each story” But still, it would be required that the writer is creative enough to develop the plotline into an actual story with all that it entails.  The time frame for each book to be completed in five weeks.  The professionals we are looking for should want to be part of a long-term relationship involving several projects in a row. Familiarity with the series and characters helps increase the quality of the stories, so the more you write about these characters, the better the stories get.  But we would also consider writers who would prefer to work on just a couple of projects. A long-term commitment is not required, only desirable.

0|228|Romance writers needed long term to work on a series - Pick your sub-genre - 140k words total|"Do you enjoy writing for any of the following Romance sub-genres? (You can also choose to write regular Romance if you prefer) Action & Adventure Anthologies Billionaires Black & African American Clean & Wholesome Contemporary Erotica Fantasy Gothic Historical Holidays Inspirational LGBT Medical Military Multicultural New Adult & College Paranormal Regency Romantic Comedy Romantic Suspense Science Fiction Sports Time Travel Vampires Werewolves & Shifters Western Writing  I am looking to hire a couple of ""Great"" writers to write a few, original content stories that I can give away to our readers on our website.  You would be needed long term to write a series of 7 books, each no less than 20,000 words.  Each book would end in a cliff hanger and pick up where the last one left off, just like a television series.  Each book should have main and supporting characters that could eventually go off into a spin off series of their own.  I am open to paying $250- per book in the series, so $1750.00 for all 7 (One at a time)  Before you bid please note the following:  #1- To begin with, we will start with modeling a book that I personally like. I will give you it’s book blurb and 100 of it’s reviews to read through. By reading the reviews you’ll note what readers love about the book that I will give you these for as well as what they dislike.  From there you will be required to “model” the plot spoken about in the reviews and format the “OVER ALL” plot of the series that you will be writing, as well as the plot of each book(so 8 plots in total for the 7 books eries)  The above must be done and handed over to me for review BEFORE you start writing.   #2- I require that *Every Single Sentence* of what you write come from your own creative mind… In other words, I will check every single line of the content that you hand in and will ONLY accept 110% original material.  I will NOT accept nor will I pay for plagiarized content.. Even if you simply borrow 1 sentence out of 20,000+ words…  EVERYTHING must be 100% unique and created by you and you must be willing to sign a contract stating that YOU and only YOU created the content. (will require that you sign a notarized contract agreeing to this.)  #3- I need these to be formatted for Kindle eReaders (including hyperlinked table of contents)  #4- I will own all rights to the finished product once you are paid for it. That means I will own the byline rights, resale rights, ownership rights, copyrights and everything else and will require that you sign a contract agreeing to this.  #5- Your written English must be 150% on target (much better than mine ;-) In fact I am mainly looking for writers from the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K.  For each story I require:  ** A mini ""series"" with ""regular"" characters where each story ends in a “Cliff hanger”. Meaning each ending is a continuation of the last and leaves the reader in suspense… And in the next story you’ll have to deliver on what the cliff hanger promised in the last story, make sense?  A complete 1 page synopsis detailing what the story is about (This must be at least 300 words)  ** This should be written in Times New Roman  - 20,000+ words per story  I hate sounding so formulaic but I get a lot of jokers who bid and try to pull fast ones, so with that said I am only looking for series, long term people who LOVE to write stories of this nature because I will have a TON of work for you.  When bidding be sure to add the phrase “Get It Right” at the VERY beginning of your bid / message so I know you took the time to fully read this project description and are not just bidding blindly ;-)   You should be available long term as I am looking for more long term writers on our team.   I would like to have you create a continuous “mini-series”, with each 20,000+ word “story” having a cast of regular characters (as well as new people being introduced from time to time).   This is easy stuff and if you are good and your price is good I can give you very regular work.   Show samples of your other work that is SIMILAR (Not a must to apply)   Questions for Freelancers  1.-Have you ever written anything similar?  2- Do you have samples that are YOURS? (Not someone else’s work but yours)  3- Are you available long term as in 1 year +  4- How many 20,000+ word stories can you write a month? Please answer honestly as I hate to have you commit to more than you can handle.  5- Of those that I have listed in this project posting, please let me know which sub-genre of Romance you most enjoy writing content for (You can also pick the main category of Romance)   I'm looking to pay $250.00 per 20,000 word story with clifhanger, but you must commit to writing all 7 stories in the series for which ever genre you choose"||||Intermediate|/Ghostwriting Deliverables,Ebook,Speeches,Script,Screenplay,Novel,Article,Blog Content,Biography,Autobiography,Lyrics,Website Content/Ghostwriting Services,Ghostwriting,Editing & Proofreading,Fact-Checking,Researcher/Other,Ebook Writing,Humor Writing,Writing,Ghostwriting,Article Writing,Fiction Writing,Speech Writing,Copywriting,Creative Writing,Content Writing,Blog Writing,Content Editing,Proofreading,Editor,Book Writing,Social Media Marketing,Technical Writing,Online Writing,Content Creation,Microsoft Excel,Comedy,Nonfiction,Romance,Poetry,Young Adult,Fiction,Fantasy,Drama,Science Fiction,Children's Writing,Thriller,Crime,Dystopian,Mystery,Satire,English,US English Dialect||5.0|United States Garner|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01b8f6378de838d812

0|617|Grant Researcher, Writer, Editor|Hello! Our nonprofit organization, USA Green Communities, was founded in Santa Barbara, CA in 2010, by a former mayor of Santa Barbara and pioneer of the environmental movement, Hal Conklin, who was instrumental in the establishment of what is now Earth Day, following a massive oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel in 1969. Our flagship project is a Green Products Database of independently certified green products and services. With a $500,000 grant from Wells Fargo, Phase One of the project was completed prior to the pandemic (and Hal's passing last year as a result of a brain tumor), and the database currently contains over 120,000 certified products. Our goal is 200,000+ products, and is inspired by a similar project (though much smaller) in South Korea, which also includes a green credit card that provides incentives and points for sustainable purchasing to over 18-million users. We recently received unsolicited interest in our database by the head of product sustainability for the largest online retailer on the planet (guess who?). Since the database is owned by our nonprofit organization, which funds development of the database through an independent contractor, we need to raise $1.3-million over the next 12 months to complete the project. Grants will be key to achieving this goal. The organization has deep roots and connections locally and nationally, and we believe that there is certainly sufficient support out there for this project. We would be looking to apply for grants at the 25k-500k levels. Much of the copy for this project has been written, via a 12-page Program/Business Plan.

Beyond a lifestyle of doing less bad, but stepping into doing more good, being a vector of regeneration, a participant in direct restoration of ecology, community and local economy. My thesis revolves around eco-villages participating in regenerative micro-industry as being a critical long term solution that will be relevant beyond immediate technological mitigations. I have a broad qualitative argument for why people living in eco-villages being paid to create regenerative life giving systems is fundamental, for one, taking folks out of endless cycles of self soothing through consumerism into a life of purpose and connection. I am building a fractally scalable toolbox and process for building regenerative communities. Come help lay the stones that other can build from, build a world that we are happy to live in a proud to hand down.  In many cases my proposals are logical next steps for supply chain and manufacturing, but I need to strengthen the part of the argument that is most core to my purpose, climate, ecology, social etc.  For now I need to focus on unpacking carbon sequestration and climate change into its sub-pieces like soil regeneration, biodiversity, circular supply chains etc.  You are a researcher who has previous experience in climate research and can feel a magnetism to what I am describing. You are a critical thinker who can find blindspots and identify credible resources.  I Eli, am an inventor, entrepreneur, and decentralized systems architect.

The questions will be provided by Client Connect, while the answers will be provided by the freelancer through legal research. The answers will be legally accurate and succinct (ideally 1-2 sentences in length). The use case for these Q&As is to create social media content, so the answers should be written for the mass public.  Example Question: When can eminent domain be used?  Example Answer: The ability of a government or company to take private property is limited by the “public purpose” concept. The legislatures are charged with structuring laws that are in harmony with our constitutional provisions to protect private property from being taken for purposes that are beyond the “public purpose” limitation.  The ideal freelancer is a law student / recent graduate or a paralegal student / recent graduate with a good understanding of US law, legal research, and legal jargon. A good grasp of social media marketing and Oklahoma law is a big plus.  Project Scope: 20 questions Project Prerequisites: Access to fast/reliable internet and know-how using Google Sheets  Upon successful / satisfactory completion, the scope could expand to include more questions and topics as follow-up projects.||||Entry level|/Legal Writing Services,Legal Writing,Content Writing/Written Languages,English/Other,Legal Research,Social Media Content Creation,Google Sheets||5.0|United States Pryor|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0192edffa18418365a

Our audience is small to medium sized employers from every U.S. state (roughly 10% from California), and the roughly 60-minute webinar session includes a brief summary of recent legislative action and a 45-minute Questions and Answers period.  The brief should be approximately 750-1,250 words (it can go over slightly if need be) and address the following, either in depth or in brief, depending on the opinion of the attorney who accepts the assignment:  • Recent guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission • Key state and municipal equal employment laws • Long-COVID designation and accommodations • Sexual harassment arbitration ban • Discrimination in hiring and promotion • Assessing disability accommodation requests • Equal pay and pay transparency laws • Ensuring equality in COVID-19 response policies   NOTE:  This list of webinar topics may evolve based on the subject matter expert’s recommendations. Any other pertinent topics relating current equal employment opportunity laws should be added at your discretion.  The webinars are run by us in the office and you will join us via Go-to-Webinar. We introduce you, your background, and then have an outline prepared that you would use (we run the presentation on our end). Once the introductory presentation is completed, we open it up to a Q and A session with our customers (they write in the questions, we read them to you, and you answer). The guest speaker will present on-camera for approximately 10 minutes, answer question from customers (primarily business owners and HR representatives) and end the session with summary list of key takeaways.  See an example of a previous webinar here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpFrppTmZuI  Overall, if you agree to participate, it would require you to attend two rehearsals and then serve as guest speaker on the final webinar. Each of these steps takes approximately one hour. There will be minimal preparation time needed for the webinar outside of familiarizing yourself with your topic’s employer implications.  You would not need to physically be in our presence at any time. All of this is done over the phone and Internet via Go-to-Webinar.

Subject: Search Engine Optimization|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u2Jf9S-fEsjXVhWvliVIMTDiu-BWPF0ptcBzbyZWGsc/edit?usp=sharing';  UppercutSEO content writer guide  Hello - I’m the owner of an SEO company and I need a highly skilled writer to write about 60 articles for my website.  The main topic is Search Engine Optimization.  The subtopics are: content writing onpage SEO link building Google ranking strategies  I would prefer to work with a writer that is already well informed in the subjects above.  All of the articles I need are organized in a spreadsheet with a topic, title, and an excellent reference link or document.  The articles are basically rewrites of the references I provide, so you won’t need to do any more research to complete the articles, but I do need the pieces to be better than the references, so I would encourage you to do some research to go deeper into each article and topic. Following the links inside each reference document will help you accomplish this.  Some of the material is technical 6000 word articles like this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sT913indTHcF6inGW35oY5IzdRQSdC1WkX6XytMsFOs/edit?usp=sharing  Some articles are 2500 words and simpler like this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CXtr9j8VlzkU17ARE9R81Yq2zWuDD0dnPN5am-dd-OE/edit?usp=sharing    Notes: PLEASE ask questions. Just send me a message if there’s something you’re not 100% sure about.  This should be a collaboration. I’ve been doing SEO professionally for 15 years, so I can help you understand anything in any of these references.   Building a long term relationship: I will always need content for this website, so I’m looking for a writer to grow with and to have a long lasting relationship.   Important Requests Be as simple, clear, and concise as possible.  Keep your audience engaged. You’re writing for digital marketing agencies, business owners, and affiliate marketers that want to rank their websites and get new business and make sales online. SEO is the key to their success and this knowledge is SO important to them.  You’re writing directly to them and you can refer to them as “you”.  Be playful, funny, and positive.  Follow the basic outline of each reference.  Re-arrange the list order, for example: Top 15 mistakes to avoid….don’t use the same order as the reference. Mix them up and always write unique header and subheaders.  Always use unique examples, comparisons, and metaphors.  No boilerplate or repeated call to action needed.  Use different numbers and % than the references use. Just change it a tiny bit to make it original.  If the article is a “12 tips for ….” type, rewrite each tip. I might add one later.  Use bullet points when possible. The references use bullets in appropriate places, please try to rewrite while providing similar information.  Be careful when the reference mentions a study or “a presentation given by….” or “As Dan Muller from Google says…..” It’s best to state the facts but not mention the exact same study. You can just say “Studies have been done…”  Be careful when the article refers to something that isn't a common SEO term, because it might be a term coined by the writer of that article. Please message me if you’re unsure.  Regarding images in the reference docs: Please add [IMAGE] in your piece where you see one in the reference doc. IThis will help me know where to create and add my own images.  Add [TEXT - IMAGE] when you see that there’s a paragraph of technical SEO that precedes an image, if you think it would make more sense for me to write that paragraph.  For example, the writer might give a very specific example of keyword research or link building and reference a screenshot of an SEO tool. This is a good time to use  [TEXT - IMAGE]||More than 30 hrs/week|More than 6 months||/Written Languages,English/Technical Writing Deliverables,Blog Content,Article/Other,Search Engine Optimization,Content Writing,SEO Writing,Copywriting,Search Engine Optimization Report|$20.00|5.0|United States Austin|5.00|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0173797c3d01351e53

How does Month2month rental pricing work?   Hi relocation partners, We know you care about fair market rental value as much as we do. As a property investment company, we’d like to share how we calculate our rental pricing to ensure our property investors achieve their goal for return over investment while committing to the transparency and fair rental price for you and your clients.      Take a property at Fontana CA for example. If the monthly rent estimate for a long term lease is $3000 unfurnished, we put it up for this market and have it easily rent out without worrying about proper procedures, customer service or vacancy rate due to frequent turnovers.    Now to meet the needs of the furnished housing for relocations,  let’s take a 2-month-lease as an example. The furnishing cost is estimated at a monthly rental cost of $2000 (check Cort Furniture Rental rate for reference) or similar depreciation cost if purchasing.  A 2-4 week vacancy (let’s use 3-week at $2250 rent loss, amortized into two months, that is $1125 per month) due to the turnover is taken into consideration, then our $600 monthly management cost is added to the calculation. The monthly price for this property is  set at $6725=（3000+2000+1125+600）  That’s how our properties are priced consistently for this relocation market without any hidden fee.  We are very transparent to all our partners and have simplified our booking process through customized tools provided to our preferential partners for free.|$39.99|Less than 30 hrs/week|Less than a month|Intermediate|Writing,Letter Writing,Newsletter Writing,Business Correspondence,Event Management,Corporate Event Planning,Data Entry,Email Marketing,General Transcription,Press Release|$39.99||United States Irvine|4.35|https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01146f7774d426296a
